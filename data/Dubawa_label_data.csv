Misleading! McGill and Cllr. Cephus was not sacked; they resigned,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim:A senior strategist on the Campaign Team of the Collaborating Political Party (CPP), George Wisner, claimed “Cllr. Sayma Syrenius Cephus, former solicitor general of Liberia and Nathaniel McGill, former minister of state and chief of staff of Liberia’s President, George M. Weah were fired.”Verdict: Misleading! McGill and Cllr. Cephus were not sacked. Instead, they resigned after President Weah suspended them.Full TextA senior strategist on the campaign team of the Collaborating Political Parties (CPP), George Wisner, has claimed “Cllr. Sayma Syrenius Cephus and Nathaniel McGill were fired.”Nathaniel McGill and Cllr. Sayma Syrenius Cephus was a former senior official of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change-led government who served as Minister of State and Solicitor General of Liberia, respectively.The United States Treasury Department sanctioned the two men for acts of corruption under the Global Magnitsky Act. In discussing the issues on Wednesday, July 18, 2023, on Truth 96.1FM, Mr Wisner claimed the officers were sacked around the 1:52:40 – 1:53:55 of the recording.Mr Wisner alleged that the reason why former Minister McGill and Cllr. Cephus were disgraced by the United States of America and subsequently left the government because they lied against his political leader, Alexander Benedict Cummings.Mr Wisner indicated, “Mr Cummings is a son of a pastor, and so when people lie against Mr Cummings, there will always be consequences.”Mr Wisner alleged that both McGill and Cephus instigated the lawsuit and chief prosecutor of the case involving a court case against the standard bearer of the ANC and the CPP, respectively.It can be recalled that a constituent member of the CPP, the All Liberian Party took Mr Cummings to court over allegations of tempering with the CPP’s document but was set free based on lack of evidence.VerificationTo begin with, DUBAWA first contacted the claimant, Mr Wisner, via WhatsApp to provide evidence of his claim.As seen in the screenshot below, Mr Wisner has yet to respond to the message.DUBAWA then discovered through several media outlets, including the Voice of America (VOA-Africa) and The Analyst Newspaper, that the two former senior government officials of the ruling CDC resigned instead of being fired.DUBAWA obtained copies of their resignation letters and found a statement on the official website of Liberia Executive Mansion, wherein the Liberian president accepted letters from his two senior officials.Below is an excerpt from the letter of resignation dated September 9, 2022, former Solicitor General of Liberia, Cllr. Sayma Syrinus Cephus to President George Manneh Weah.ConclusionMr Wisner’s assertion that Mr McGill and Mr Cephus were sacked is misleading.",01/08/2023,https://dubawa.org/misleading-mcgill-and-cllr-cephus-was-not-sacked-they-resigned/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Weah’s CDC fails to uphold 40% quota promise for women in party elections,Varney Dukuly,"President George Weah's three-party-led government 2022 adopted a 40% women quota resolution to give women a voice to contest the parliamentary seats on the party’s ticket.The new policy was made for the party to push at least 40% of women into leadership positions.According to the CDC, the new policy was binding on the party. The policy came when the party failed to produce a single female candidate in mid-term senatorial elections.The party’s political leader and self-proclaimed ‘Feminist-in-Chief’ President Weah, has continuously lauded the idea of promoting women in politics. But has his ideas translated into reality, using the 40% women quota resolution as a benchmark?DUBAWA looks deeper into the quota system announced by the CDC government to promote women in governance and assess whether the Weah-led government is walking the talk.Outlook of women in politics before Weah’s LiberiaIn 2005, the West African nation became the first country in Africa to produce a female as President amidst the patriarchal outlook of the society. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Liberia’s first female president, earned herself global recognition by winning a Nobel Prize for peace.Her ascendency to the president's seat allowed women and girls across Liberia and the rest of Africa to find their voices by enhancing their representation in public office.Madam Sirleaf 2017 democratically ushered in George Weah as President after serving her term. There was, therefore, the need to maintain gender representation in governance even after the tenure of Sirleaf Johnson.As a result, President Weah proclaimed himself as ‘Feminist-in-Chief’ with the promise to give women a louder voice in the democratic governance of Liberia.The CDC Chairman Mulbah Morlu no sooner called the President to appoint more women to top positions.“After 17 years, the National Executive Committee of the CDC has unanimously adopted a resolution requiring 40 per cent political participation for women throughout its leadership structures and parliamentary seats in pending general elections,” said party Chairman Mulbah Morlu.“Additionally, the party NEC is calling on the president to appoint more qualified women to significant positions in government as a necessary step to close the gender gap,” Morlu added.During the party’s 17th anniversary in 2022, he made the call, thus cementing a Gender quota measure for all of its internal and external democratic processes.So did the ‘Feminist-in-chief’ and his party appoint more women into the party’s top hierarchy and cabinet, as prayed for by the party’s chairman and demanded by the party’s resolution?To answer this question objectively, it is important to understand the quota resolution passed by the CDC government.The general idea of the Quota system is to recruit women into political positions and ensure that women sit in the corridors of power and participate in the country's decision-making.The ruling party, therefore, agreed that its 40% women quota adopted in 2022 was binding to have women in leadership on its ticket ahead of the pending elections.In addition to the 40% women quota in its internal party election, the governing party also promised a 30% women participation to ensure women are fairly represented in government.DUBAWA’s research showed that since 2019 women’s representation in the legislature has been at 12.3%, ranked 151 among 192 countries in the world.During the mid-term Senatorial elections in December 2020, women accounted for just 20 out of 118 eligible candidates in the Special Senatorial Elections, with the ruling CDC nominating all men.The worryingly low figures for women's participation in politics and governance made the CDC promise very crucial. Yet, after the CDC primary results for the October 10 elections, the data does not show a party walking the talk on women's participation.Our findings showed that the ruling CDC has 9.5% of women for parliamentary seats in the pending elections, not 40% as demanded by the resolution. The party primary produced only 11 female candidates out of 87 winners on October 10.For example, out of the 87 winners emerging from the CDC’s recent primaries across the 15 counties, only 12 were females constituting far below the documented and reaffirmation resolutions that call for 30 or 40%.Attached is the link officially from the CDC's recent primaries for the upcoming electionsThe party chairman, Mulbah Morlu, failed to honour an interview with DUBAWA for clarity or to state why the party picked more men than women for the upcoming Presidential and Legislative elections amidst a standing resolution for 40% quota women.Below are WhatsApp exchanges with him.ConclusionEven though the 40% women quota is only a year into implementation, DUBAWA can state, using the CDC's recent primaries as a benchmark, that the party has failed to honour its promise to promote 40% women into its leadership.",31/07/2023,https://dubawa.org/weahs-cdc-fails-to-uphold-40-quota-promise-for-women-in-party-elections/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Former Vice President did not accuse President Weah of selling ‘Kush’ to young people,Varney Dukuly,"Claim: Vice chairman of Liberia Anti Corruption Commission Kanio Bai Gbala says he heard the former vice president in a viral video in Bong County accusing President Weah of selling Kush to young people.Verdict: Misleading! DUBAWA’s in-depth investigation and analysis of the video referenced byMr Bai Gbala do not support the claim.Full TextIt is not yet a campaign period, but Liberian politicians and their supporters have hit the ground running with allegations.The latest of the claims is said by the outgoing vice chairman at Liberia Anti Corruption Commission, Cllr Kanio Bai Gbala, who told the OK Conversation that a major opposition candidate Joseph Boakai recently accused the president of being a kush peddler.Kanio made the particular assertion on the show at about one hour thirty-three (1:33:33sec) in the programme discussion.He said before a crowd of supporters in Bong County that the former VP also accused the Liberian leader of selling kush to young people in Liberia, making him a drug dealer.“The Former Vice President goes to Gbarnga, Bong County, to a political rally and makes an allegation that President Weah is the one selling Kush to young people, labelling the sitting President of this country as being a drug dealer is something to look at,” said Bai Gbala.The claimant’s disclosure comes at a time when the intake of drugs among young people has become a call for a national emergency. The government of Liberia recently failed to win a major US$100 million drug case against some foreign nationals.The country was used as a transit for cocaine, and it took the U.S. government intelligence to expose the drug bust. The ensuing court case from the incident was poorly litigated by the government, leading to a defeat.So when Cllr Kanio Bai Gbala, an ally to the President, revealed on radio against opposition politician Joseph Boakai about drug trade linking president Weah, DUBAWA took an interest in it.VerificationIt was established that during this month, the opposition Unity Party standard bearer Joseph Boakai went to Bong County as part of his ongoing county tour to the 15 counties.DUBAWA decided to demand from the claimant evidence of his allegation against the president, as seen in the following screenshots.A screenshot of the conversationIn furtherance to queries from DUBAWA, he provided a video and link to a story in which the former vice president spoke on Liberia’s drug issue.These were the exact words of the former vice president in the video which Kanio sent as a reply to DUBAWA on the drug claim,“Instead of paving roads, instead of giving them education, they say we should give them Kush, and this is the time to push Kush out and bring development to this country.”DUBAWA’s assessment of the video in Bong County showed that the former VP did mention Kush, but at no point did he mention the president selling it to citizens, as claimed by Kanio.ConclusionAfter a rigorous assessment of the claim, it is apparent that the former vice president did not accuse the president of selling kush.",23/07/2023,https://dubawa.org/former-vice-president-did-not-accuse-president-weah-of-selling-kush-to-young-people/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Misleading! Liberia does not have world’s highest rainfall rate,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: The presidential hopeful and political leader of the Movement for Progressive Change (MPC), Simeon Freeman, has said “Liberia has the highest rate of rainfall in the world.”Verdict: Liberia is not the country with the highest rainfall rate, according to BasicPlanet and az Animal.Full TextSimeon Freeman, a presidential hopeful in Liberia’s upcoming presidential and legislative elections, claimed that “Liberia has the highest rate of rainfall in the world.”Mr Freeman, the political leader of the Movement for Progressive Change (MPC), made this claim when he appeared on national radio, Okay 99.5FM, to tell the Liberians about his presidential ambition.Mr Freeman was a prime guest of the station’s flagship programme, The Okay Morning Rush. The show was simulcast on several other radio stations and online media outlets in the country, including Front Page Africa and Fortune TV.During the programme, Mr Freeman claimed, “Liberia has the highest rainfall rate in the world.”Mr Freeman made the claim around the 2:20:40 to 2:20:50 hours of the almost three-hour show.Mr Freeman stated that under his regime as president of Liberia, he would not concentrate on building roads because it may stall the nation’s development.Mr Freeman said, “We’ve got two seasons, dry and rainy seasons. We have torrential rain, and we have the highest rainfall in the world. People forget these things, so focusing on roads can hold back our progress.”VerificationDUBAWA then decided to ascertain the facts of the claim. To begin with, DUBAWA first contacted the claimant, Mr Freeman, about his claim via messenger, as seen in the screenshot below, but he is yet to reply.DUBAWA also discovered that according to the basicplanet website Liberia is not amongst the top ten countries with the highest rate of rainfall. Colombia tops the list.DUBAWA also browsed through other websites like the AZ Animal, which in its June 26, 2023, report ranked Colombia as the country with the highest precipitation, with a downpour of 3,240 millimetres per year.ConclusionBased on DUBAWA’s brief research, Simeon Freeman’s assertion turns out to be misleading.",20/07/2023,https://dubawa.org/misleading-liberia-does-not-have-worlds-highest-rainfall-rate/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
False! All Liberian Party not fielding presidential ticket in October,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: A viral flier on social media (Facebook, WhatsApp and Messenger groups) has named Henry P Costa and River-Gee County Senator Jonathan Boycharles Sogbie as the Standard bearer and Vice Standard-bearer of the All Liberian Party (ALP) in the upcoming Liberian elections.Verdict: False! The party's Chairman clarifies that the All Liberian Party (ALP) has yet to officially name any presidential ticket in Liberia's upcoming Oct. 10, 2023, elections.Full TextLiberia is expected to go to the polls and elect its new political leaders, including a president and vice president, 73 representatives and 15 senators, on October 10.As a result, political parties are now forming party tickets, consisting of a presidential and a vice presidential candidate for the upcoming electoral process. Liberian businessman-turned-politician Benoni W. Urey established the All Liberian Party in 2017.The 2017 legislative and presidential elections were the ALP's first national elections, and the party came sixth out of 20 political parties and obtained 24,246 votes amounting to 1.56%.With less than 100 days to the country’s upcoming legislative and presidential elections, social media, specifically Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp, have been flooded with a flier bearing the photograph of talk-show host and political commentator Henry P. Costa. It also carries River-Gee County Senator Jonathan Boycharles Sogbie as the ALP's standard bearer.According to a social media blog, The Liberian Influence, both Costa and Senator Sogbie have been selected by the All Liberian Party (ALP) as its standard and vice-standard bearers in the upcoming Liberian elections.The post has over 100 emojis and 40 comments.VerificationBased on the importance of this claim and the huge public interest it has generated, DUBAWA decided to verify the claim on the viral flier.DUBAWA contacted the All Liberian Party (ALP) chairman, Theodore Momo, via phone to find out if the claim is valid.During the phone call conversation with DUBAWA, the ALP’s chairman said that the party did not conclude to field the two persons captured in the viral poster for the upcoming elections.Chairman Momo said, “We do not run our party on social media. Therefore, I do not know where this is coming from and the intent of those behind it. There are processes and procedures laid down within our party on how we go about selecting presidential and vice presidential candidates within our party, and it includes nominations and convention among other processes.”He furthered, “Currently, we are focused on selecting our senatorial and representative candidates for now, and I cannot tell you uprightly whether or not we are going to field a presidential candidate during these elections.”DUBAWA also contacted Henry P. Costa, who is also a member of the party and is currently in the United States of America, about the flier. Still, he is yet to respond to our inquiry.Finally, DUBAWA reached out to Senator Jonathan Sogbie. The man alleged to be the vice standard bearer on the flier, to inquire whether he knew about it.Senator Sogbie said that though his face is on it, he has no idea about being selected as a vice standard bearer for the ALP.Senator Sogbie noted, “Let me thank you for the inquiry, and I would like to clearly state that the photo is mine, but I did not consent to be a running mate to anyone. I’m a member of the ANC and support the candidacy of Mr Cummings. Please let this serve as reliance for your reportage.”Here are screenshots from the WhatsApp conversation between DUBAWA and Senator Jonathan Boycharles SogbieConclusionThe information in the viral flier is false based on research conducted by DUBAWA and all the evidence available from speaking to all sides involved.

The controversial 60% budget cut for Liberia’s October elections and matters arising,Gloria Wleh,"With barely four months to go for the people of Liberia to go to the polls, a cut in the election budget has reignited a new debate in Liberia over whether the Electoral Commission there is ready to supervise free, fair and transparent elections in October.DUBAWA takes a critical look at the money factor in a yet-to-be-organised election that holds the political destiny of the government and people of Liberia.The cutIn March this year, the Chairperson of the National Elections Commission (NEC), Madame Davidetta Browne Lansanah, disclosed that the budget for the October 10 General and Presidential Elections was “adjusted by the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP) from US$91million to US$33million.”The cut ruffled a few feathers, including that of the United States government, which did not hold back its disappointment. Through its Ambassador, Micheal McCarthy, the US called on the government of Liberia to “provide the Elections Commission with its full 2023 budget, so it has the necessary resources to effectively prepare for and implement all aspects of the electoral process, or risk unfair elections in 2023.”Impact of the cutThe cut in the budget has significantly affected the operations of the NEC. For instance, the Biometric Voter Registration (BVR) which should have been conducted in one phase, was done in two phases.The Training of Trainers (TOT), which should have also been conducted for ten days, was done in fewer days, which may likely affect the quality of training. As if that is not enough, there have been huge complaints over the shortages of BVR cards nationwide.NEC defenceResponding to the over sixty per cent (60%) cut in the elections’ budget, the Communication Director of the NEC, Henry Flomo said,“The budget was debated and adjusted by the government. The last time I checked, it was adjusted to around US$63 million. Cut-in elections budgets always happen. What the NEC is now doing is strategizing to work in what we have.”Flomo recommended that the NEC be given financial autonomy to work easily and promptly, void of any adjustments.“The Commission has a constitutional mandate, which is to conduct elections in time. So, a lot of things will be adjusted as the cash is adjusted. But when we have control over our financial coffers, we can go there anytime to get whatever we want,” he stated.Flomo, however, urged members of the public not to panic about the credibility of the upcoming elections, saying no part of the electoral process will be compromised.“There should be no reason to picnic. The issue of transparency is being upheld by us. That is why we have accredited media people, civil society organisations, party agents, international people and those who want to observe or report on the registration to do so.“And we have not stopped any of the activity leading to the participation or inclusion of every Liberian who has an interest in the elections. So there’s no way one would say democracy is threatened. Until those things are stopped, then one can say the democracy of the state is threatened,” he added.When asked if the adjusted money allocated for this year’s elections was sufficient for the conduct of the election, Flomo responded by saying, “My boss has already spoken about that to the House of Senate.”CSO ReactionThe Elections Coordinating Committee (ECC) which is a coalition of civic society organisations that observe elections in Liberia, also weighed in on the matter.Chairperson of the ECC, Oscar Bloh, stated:“NEC, in negotiating with the Ministry of Finance, adjusted the budget. They are in the know if the budget reduction is sufficient to conduct the elections. If it wasn’t sufficient, they would have said it; by keeping silent means the money is enough.”The ECC Chairperson indicated that the elections are constitutionally mandated, and it’s the government’s responsibility to provide resources for successful elections. He added it is constitutionally scheduled, and as such, they (the government) should have planned better.Oscar Bloh recounted, “The Liberia Revenue Authority on numerous occasions said it had exceeded projected revenue collection. So, the government is in a position to fund these elections. It needs to prioritize these elections by showing its commitment and will because it is required by law.”He feared the quality of the elections if the required resources are not readily available.“If resources are slow in coming, it will undermine the quality of the elections. And when the process is compromised, we run the risk of compromising the outcome,” Bloh noted.But there are other electoral support interventions from foreign nations and organizations to the NEC. The Liberia Electoral Support Project (LEDP) supports the Government of Liberia through the National Elections Commission (NEC) to conduct credible, transparent, inclusive, and peaceful elections just as the United Nations Elections Basket, to name a few.On July 30, 2021, the Embassy of Sweden in Monrovia, representing the Government of Sweden, signed an agreement with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to contribute approximately USD 4.8 million to the Liberia Electoral Support Project (LESP) for the period from August 1, 2021, to December 31, 2024.Speaking also to the cut of the budget, the Head of Media and Public Relations of the former ruling Unity Party (UP), Kula Fofana said the cutting of the budget by the Weah-led administration is a planned tactic to compromise the outcome of the elections.According to Fofana, the election date was constitutionally set a long time ago; as such, the government should have handled proper budgetary planning for the elections to empower the NEC to discharge its constitutional mandate efficiently.She called on the NEC to raise more awareness about its insufficient elections funds, saying the NEC is not financially positioned to conduct the upcoming Legislative and Presidential elections.Could it be that due to some of those technical supports given to the NEC, the budget for the upcoming elections received such a huge cut? Or is it just about the routine that the MFDP should cut election budgets almost every time? The world watches as the NEC leads Liberia from scratch to finish during these crucial electioneering times of the country.",03/07/2023,https://dubawa.org/the-controversial-60-budget-cut-for-liberias-october-elections-and-matters-arising/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Misleading! The Invincible Sports Park was budgeted in 2022 national budget,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: Finance and Development Planning Minister Samuel Tweah and Liberia Maritime Authority Commissioner Eugene Lenn Nagbe claimed: “the Invincible Sports Park was constructed by President Weah and his friends.”Verdict: Misleading! Checks by DUBAWA show that a portion of the funds used to construct the Invincible Sports Park was budgeted for in the 2022 national budget, while other state institutions contributed financially to the project.Full TextLiberia is expected to go to polls on October 10 this year to elect new leaders, including the president, vice president, 73 representatives and 15 senators whose tenures are about to end.The elections will most likely be won or lost based on the opposition’s promises and credibility or the track record, achievements or failures of the incumbent. As the campaign heats up, two senior officials of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) led administration headed by soccer icon George Weah took to the national radio to outline the gains made by the CDC government in the last six years.Finance and development planning Minister Samuel Tweah and the Liberia Maritime Authority Commissioner Eugene Lenn Nagbe appeared on the state-owned media outlet, the Liberia Broadcasting System or ELBC, to talk about progress made by the CDC government.The show carried on the LBS online radio and Television, LNTV, was also covered by several media institutions, including Front Page Africa and D-TV online.During the show, the Liberia Maritime Authority Commissioner, Eugene Lenn Nagbe, claimed that President George Weah built the Invincible Sports Park with support from his friends.Commissioner Nagbe was responding to a question asked by one of the journalists on the show about whether some of the projects undertaken by the Liberian leader were executed with his personal or government funds.Nagbe said, “The Pro-Poor housing and the market structure the president is building are direct results of what the people asked for when the president made his most recent counties tours. There are some projects that the president is undertaking by himself, like the Invincible Sports Park. He funded it with some support from his friends.”He made this claim over the four hours show from 2:25:57 to 2:26:05 hours.Commissioner Nagbe's claim was also buttressed by his colleague, Minister Samuel Tweah, during the show.Minister Tweah said, “To be clear and honest with you, the Invincible Sports Park was funded by the president because people have tried to bring this president down on the basis of lies, and we are here to fight falsehood. I am happy that the Liberian people no longer believe the lie, so they are flat-footed. They are still bent on spreading lies on their Facebook pages saying that the Invincible Park was built from the government budget, no it was [not], and we are very clear on that one.”Minister Tweah’s comments came around the 2:35:35 – 2:36:14 hours of the over four-hour show on Monday, June 19, 2023.The interview has garnered over 7,000 views with over 615 comments. DUBAWA decided to verify the claim due to controversy and the interest the claim generated.VerificationTo start with, DUBAWA sighted a February 9, 2021, video in which President George Weah broke grounds for the construction of the Invincible Sports Park, located in Sinkor, Fish Market, directly opposite the home of ex-Liberian President Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.At the program, President Weah said that he felt obligated to the people of the area where the park is constructed because, according to him, it was where he used to play when he started his footballing career.The Liberian leader said, “I, therefore, want you to know that I am developing this public park as my personal contribution to the people of this area.”President Weah made the remarks at 35:24-36:00 minutes/seconds of his speech during the groundbreaking ceremony.But was the Invincible Park built solely with funds from the president?The Minister of State without Portfolio, Trokon Kpui, appeared to have contradicted the claim that the president built the Park from his own and friends' funds. He said on the Spoon Talk programme on April 5, 2022, that part of the funding for the project came from state institutions.Minister Kpui said, “This is the president's project, but we also have funds coming from the National Port Authority (NPA), National Social Security and Welfare Corporation (NASCRP) and the Liberia Maritime Authority (LiMA).”Minister Kpui appeared on the show in his official capacity as chief administrator of the project and made the claim on the show between 1:19:53 to 1:20:20 hours.The show was carried live on the institution’s official Facebook page.According to him, the president funded 60% of the budget for the Invincible Park, and the remaining 40% came from state coffers.Despite this contradiction, DUBAWA contacted the two senior Liberian government officials through WhatsApp to provide evidence in support of their claims that the park was built solely with funds from the president.However, the two men did not reply to DUBAWA’s questions posed to them.Here are screenshots of DUBAWA's questions to Minister Samuel Tweah and Commissioner Lenn Eugene Nagbe.DUBAWA didn’t stop there. The researcher then visited the 2022 national budget of Liberia since the project was launched in 2021. DUBAWA discovered on page 10, under the summary of the Public Sector Investment Plan (PSIP), that the government of Liberia funded the construction of the Invincible Sports Park Project under code 0720.The allotment for this Invincible Sports Park project is US$ 500,000 for 2022 and projected for under the 2023 and 2024 national budget at 400,000 and 320,000, respectively.Here is a screenshot from the 2022 budget of Liberia:ConclusionBased on the concessions made by the Administrator of the Invincible Park project and the facts available within the 2022 national budget of Liberia, the claim made by Minister Samuel Toweah and Commissioner Lenn Eugene Nagbe is misleading.",30/06/2023,https://dubawa.org/misleading-the-invincible-sports-park-was-budgeted-in-2022-national-budget/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Exaggerated! Liberia does not have over 230,000 registered motorcyclists and tricyclists",Gloria Wleh,"Claim: The President of the Federation of Motorcyclist and Tricyclist Unions (FOMTUL) of Liberia claims that “over 230,000 registered motorcyclists and tricycle operators are in Liberia.”Verdict: Exaggerated! The Ministry of Transport's latest data shows 14,704 registered motorcyclists and tricycle operators in Liberia.Full TextIn the lead-up to the October 10, 2023, general and presidential elections, the quest for endorsement is rising, and so is the love affair between politicians and the electorate. The former is doing all it can to get the voters on their side to ensure massive victory on election day.Pledging their support to the election bid of former Vice President Joseph Boakai on July 15, 2023, the president of the Federation of Motorcyclist and Tricyclist Unions of Liberia  (FOMTUL), John Kenyor, made an interesting assertion of Liberia having over 230,000 motorcyclists and tricyclists across the country.The figures called by President Kenyor, a former supporter of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC)-led government, did appear not only interesting but also alarming, given the risks of riding motorcycles and tricycles. DUBAWA, therefore, decided to verify the claim made by the head of the cyclists.VerificationThe Federation of Motorcyclist and Tricyclist Unions (FOMTUL) is a national labour federation of various unions representing the interests of motorcyclists and tricyclists across the country.The latest data obtained by this researcher from the Ministry of Transport’s Research, Statistics and Information Management Unit shows that in 2022 Liberia recorded 14,704 registered cyclists across the country.The amount is broken down under the “Report on Vehicle Registration for New License Plate Yearly Report January-December 2022” and the “Report on Vehicle Registration for Annual Renewal Stickers Yearly Report January-December.”Specifically under the “Category M: Motorcycles,” in M1, M2, and M3 are the total figures 6946 accumulated for motorcyclists recorded in the country. While M4 and M5 representing 7,758, as shown in the data, are said to be the number of tricycles in Liberia.Image of the 2022 registrations for the new license plate.Photo of the 2022 registration for annual renewal stickers.Speaking to the data obtained by this researcher, and the assertion from FOMTUL’s president that Liberia has over 230,000 motorcyclists and tricyclists, the Assistant Director for Research, Statistics and Information Management of the Ministry of Transport, Jasper White, confirmed that “cyclists who registered under the Ministry of Transport are those considered by the government as legitimate operators.”Jasper pointed out that there are bike riders who only registered with FOMTUL, which the government of Liberia does not recognise. He noted, “Any other record that does not come from the Ministry of Transport should be considered null and void.”Responding to queries from DUBAWA on whether the numbers provided are accurate in relation to the number of cyclists in Liberia, Mr Kenyor said that the figures announced during the endorsement of the standard bearer of the former ruling Unity Party are actual numbers of motorcyclists and tricyclists registered by the leadership of FOMTUL across the 15 counties by 2023.When asked to provide the documented data of the total number of cyclists the union registered, Kenyor refused, saying, “he can not make public the data recording the number of motorcyclists and tricyclists in his union.”When asked if his refusal to make public his records could be because the union exaggerated the figure, the cyclists' boss responded, “If anyone doubts the numbers, we have announced that we have pledged support to make Amb Joseph, the president, comes 2023. Let them watch and see during the elections.”Even though the official Ministry of Transport data for the number of cyclists is 14,704, DUBAWA acknowledges that there may be other cyclists operating the motorcycles whose data may not have been officially presented to the Ministry.Therefore, the researcher proceeded to The Road Safety Secretariat Liberia, the national road prevention program introduced by the Ministry of Transport.The Coordinator of the Road Safety Secretariat Liberia, Samuel Wonasue, stated that the figures emanating from the union are too high because that number does not correspond to the revenue generated from cyclists across the country.”Wonasue, however, added, “The numbers of cyclists announced by the head of cyclists could be what the FOMTUL have as its data, but the Road Safety Secretariat is building a database of cyclists across the country, and so far we have gathered over 70,000 motorcyclists and Tricyclists in Liberia.”ConclusionThe government of Liberia's latest data shows a total of 14,704 numbers of motorcyclists and tricyclists are operating in the country. Therefore, John Kenyor's claims that Liberia has over 230,000 motorcyclists and tricyclists are exaggerated.",23/06/2023,https://dubawa.org/exaggerated-liberia-does-not-have-over-230000-registered-motorcyclists-and-tricyclists/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"False! LRA, NEC not hiring",Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: A viral social media post suggests that the National Elections Commission (NEC) of Liberia and the Liberia Revenue Authority (LRA) are recruiting new staff.Verdict: False! LRA and NEC are not recruiting new employees, the two entities clarified.Full TextRecently, these viral links have flooded social media, particularly Facebook and WhatsApp, where both the National Elections Commission (NEC) of Liberia, the Liberia Revenue Authority (LRA), and the World Health Organisation are recruiting new staff.These links, especially the ones purported to be from NEC, emerged when the country is gearing up for its 4th post-war elections, which would necessitate hiring some new temporary staff to help the NEC conduct the elections across the country.The link states, “The National Elections Commission is recruiting ad hoc staff for the upcoming elections. Interested applicants should click the link below to apply now.”While the link purported to be from the Liberia Revenue Authority (LRA) said, “The Liberia Revenue Authority is inviting the general public to apply for the ongoing recruitment. Interested Applicants should click the link below to apply now.”VerificationKnowing that these claims are crucial, especially as the country prepares for its October 10, 2023, presidential and legislative elections, DUBAWA embarked on an investigation to ascertain the authenticity of the two links.To begin with, DUBAWA visited the official websites of the two institutions to compare with links that have been parading social media, and this is what we discovered.The original website of the National Elections Commission (NEC) of Liberia was completely different from the purported link.We also compared the official website of the Liberia Revenue Authority (LRA) to the purported link shared on social media.Not satisfied, DUBAWA contacted the communications officers of the two entities, Kaihenneh Sengbeh of the Liberia Revenue Authority (LRA) and Henry Flomo of the National Elections Commission.Mr Kaihenneh Sengbeh, through a WhatsApp conversation with DUBAWA, shared a press statement distancing the LRA from the said link.According to the statement, the LRA encourages the public not to give in to any such link as it only intends to steal would-be victims’ personal information and identity.The statement says, “The Liberia Revenue Authority (LRA) disassociates itself from a link circulating on social media indicating that it is hiring thousands of revenue and tax officers, including security and IT professionals. This information is false and distasteful.”Here are screenshots from the WhatsApp conversations between LRA communications Director Kaihenneh Sengbeh and DUBAWA and the press statement.DUBAWA also contacted the communications Director of the National Elections Commission, Henry Flomo, through WhatsApp but he has since refused to respond to DUBAWA’s inquiry, as seen in the screenshot belowBut DUBAWA visited the official Facebook page of the National Elections Commission (NEC) and discovered that the NEC has since distanced itself from the said account.Meanwhile, before this, the National Elections Commission has since distanced itself from several fake links indicating that the only genuine link through which members could seek employment is the one posted on their website.ConclusionBased on the evidence from the Liberia Revenue Authority and the National Elections Commission of Liberia, the two entities are not hiring, and the viral links are fake.",22/06/2023,https://dubawa.org/false-lra-nec-not-hiring/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Misleading: 56 Lawmakers did not endorse Weah, neither did Thomas Goshua",Dubawa,"By: Varney Dukuly and Jackson C. Clay, Jr.Claim: Media reports and a statement from President Weah allege that 56 lawmakers, including Thomas Goshua, Grand Bassa County District #5 Representative, have endorsed the re-election bid of Weah.Verdict: Misleading! The endorsement resolution captures the list of 49 lawmakers and not 56. Also, Representative Thomas Goshua, in a chat with DUBAWA, has denied endorsing the president.Full TextThe horse race of political endorsements among politicians has taken centre stage in Liberian politics as the country readies for the October elections.Political endorsements are a significant part of political campaigning worldwide, underlining a measure of a candidate’s popularity during elections.In the lead-up to the Presidential and Legislative Elections in Liberia, politicians seeking public offices have either been endorsed or are endorsing other candidates as jostling for popularity and votes continue unabated.Over the last few days, the ruling government has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of political endorsements.According to a statement posted on the Executive Mansion Facebook, 56 lawmakers out of 103 of the bicameral Legislature endorsed the reelection bid of President Weah on June 13.The president said the 56 members who endorsed him represented a significant percentage of the legislature's members standing behind his candidacy in the upcoming elections.Of the 56, one of them, Thomas Goshua, Grand Bassa County District #5 Representative,was given special mention by the New Republic Newspaper as one of Weah’s right-hand men who endorsed him.In receiving the endorsement, President Weah said it shows the fervent belief in his vision to change the country's developmental trajectory.Given the level of engagement and controversy the report of political endorsement has received over the last couple of days, DUBAWA has found it necessary to fact-check the claim that Thomas Goshua and 55 other lawmakers endorsed the President.VerificationAccording to Mariam Dictionary, a political endorsement stemmed from the Latin word dorsum, meaning to ‘back,’ or to approve or express support openly and definitely.So when the Liberian leader touted on his official Facebook page of the Executive Mansion that he has been endorsed by 56 lawmakers, political watchers and journalists alike became interested in finding out which lawmakers made the list.DUBAWA monitored a programme on Wednesday, June 14, 2023, on the OK Conversation, in which Representative Acarous Gray, one of those who endorsed the president for re-election, admitted that the actual number of lawmakers who signed was 49 and not 56 as indicated on the official Facebook page of the Republic.Rep. Gray, a staunch supporter of Mr Weah and a ranking member of the House of Representatives made the particular statement around 2:26:40 sec of the show.He also shared documents bearing the signatures of the 49 lawmakers to authenticate his claim. That figure is less than the 56 the E-mansion insinuated.The following is a list of the signed document;Is Thomas Goshua, Grand Bassa County District #5 Representative, part of the 56 lawmakers who endorsed the president, as alleged by the New Republic Newspaper?DUBAWA first checked the list of lawmakers said to have endorsed the president but did not find the name of Thomas Goshua.Then, the researcher reached out to the publisher of the New Republic newspaper to inquire how the Grand Bassa County lawmaker’s name was included in the publication.Mr Alphonso Toweh, through a WhatsApp conversation with DUBAWA, said that Representative Goshua’s name was on the list of those lawmakers who endorsed President Weah.When asked to share that list in question with DUBAWA, Mr Toweh referred the researcher to his paper’s official website, but no official list was seen.Here are the screenshots from the WhatsApp conversation between DUBAWA and the managing publisher of the New Republic Newspaper, Alphonso Toweh.DUBAWA then reached out to Representative Goshua to find out whether he was part of those who endorsed the president.Representative Goshua told DUBAWA through a WhatsApp conversation that he was never a part of any endorsement, adding that his allegiance is with the opposition Alternative National Congress (ANC).Representative Goshua said, “I have neither joined the CDC nor was ever a part of the lawmakers that endorsed the re-election bid of President Weah. The story is false and misleading. Matter of fact, I was at the CPP office that day for an executive committee meeting.”Here are the screenshots between DUBAWA and Representative Thomas Goshua.ConclusionBased on the investigations conducted by DUBAWA, the researcher can state that while it is true that some lawmakers have endorsed the president, it would be misleading to suggest the number of lawmakers who endorsed the president is 56 and that Thomas Goshua is one of them.",21/06/2023,https://dubawa.org/misleading-56-lawmakers-did-not-endorse-weah-neither-did-thomas-goshua/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
False! CDC printed L$48 billion not L$64 billion,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: Senator Prince Johnson of Nimba County claimed: “The Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) government printed L$ 64 billion and kept it.”Verdict: “False! The CDC government did not print L$64 billion. Instead, it printed L$48 billion.”Full TextSince he departed from the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC), Nimba County Senator and chairman of the governing council of the Movement for Democracy and Reconstruction (MDR), Prince Y. Johnson, has been critical of the CDC-led government.Senator Prince Y. Johnson used to be a good friend to the ruling establishment, a party he supported even when it was in opposition.During the 2017 election, Senator Johnson pledged the support and votes from the rich Nimba County to the CDC but has since disclosed that he regrets his action.Senator Johnson is the founding father of the opposition Movement for Democracy and Reconstructions (MDR), which is now in a political marriage with the Unity Party of former Vice President of Liberia, Amb. Joseph Nyumah Boakai.Addressing a cross-section of journalists following a protest at his Christ Chapel of Faith Church in Paynesville, Senator Johnson claimed that the government of Liberia printed L$64 billion, which they later shared with supporters.Senator Johnson made the claim at 8:45-9 min/seconds of the over 16 minutes press conference.This press conference was carried live by several media institutions in the country, including SpoonTV and DN-News.VerificationGiven that this claim has potential for public finance in Liberia, DUBAWA decided to verify it.To begin with, DUBAWA first contacted the claimant, Senator Prince Johnson, to inquire about his claim's source, but he has yet to respond, as evident below.DUBAWA then browsed Liberia’s constitution to discover what it states about the printing and minting of new currencies in the country and on documents from Parliament.According to article 34-d of the Liberian constitution, “The Legislature shall have the power to levy taxes, duties, imports, exercise and other revenues, to borrow money, issue currency, mint coins, and to make appropriations for the fiscal governance of the Republic.”Following this, DUBAWA then discovered that in 2021 the House of Representatives granted permission to the Central Bank of Liberia for the printing of L$ 48 billion and in March 2021, the Liberian Senate concurred with the House of Representatives in granting permission to the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL).Following the granting of permission to print the new family of Liberian dollar banknotes, a joint resolution was signed and issued by the legislature, consisting of both the Liberian Senate and the House of Representatives, as seen on pages 18 to 19 of the Central Bank of Liberia 2021 annual report.According to this joint resolution by both houses of the Liberian legislature, the printing and minting process should be carried out in three years, 2021, 2022 and 2024, leaving 2023 out because it is an election year. The reason for this was to avoid the ruling establishment manipulating the elections with cash.Since taking state power in 2018, this is the first printing/minting by the CDC-led government, and upon printing the first set of money, the government and the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) have duly informed the public.ConclusionBased on all of the research conducted by DUBAWA, the claim made by Senator Prince Johnson that the CDC printed L$64 billion and kept it is false.",16/06/2023,https://dubawa.org/false-cdc-printed-l48-billion-not-l64-billion/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nimely’s assertion Ghanaian MPs passed vote of no confidence against finance minister, false",Varney Dukuly,"Claim: “In 2022, the Ghanaian Congress, both the lower and the upper House, put a vote of no confidence against the Finance Minister,” said Dominic Nimely, President of the Patriotic Entrepreneurs of Liberia.Verdict: False! Ghana has a unicameral, not a bicameral, legislature, and even though the minority members of Ghana called for a vote of censure against the Finance Minister, they failed to garner the numbers on the floor for the vote of censure to pass. Credible media reports in Ghana and the BBC, Reuters, and Blomberg say the ‘Vote’ failed to pass because most members walked out.Full TextThe President of the Patriotic Entrepreneurs of Liberia, Dominic Nimely, has criticised lawmakers serving the Liberian people through the 54th National Legislature for doing little to improve the condition of Liberian businesses.Nimely said Liberians had become spectators in their economy largely because of the failure of legislators to prevail on the executive to work in the people's interest.He stressed that, unlike Liberia, parliament members in Ghana are serious-minded people whose actions reflect what the people expect.Nimely said: “The Ghanaian congress, the lower house and upper house put a vote of no confidence in the finance minister. Anybody that knows the story they will tell you, and they (parliament members) refused to go for a session.”Speaking on Wednesday, June 7, 2023, on the OK Morning Rush, a local radio station in Monrovia, he added that the economy in Ghana is facing challenges due to the underperformance of the Finance Minister, and the MPs there voted him out.Even when the host drew his attention to the fact that the vote of censure failed, Nimely insisted it passed.His analysis of lawmakers in Liberia and MPs in Ghana sought to question the laissez-faire attitudes of Legislators here in Liberia in exercising their oversight responsibility over the executive.Holding unto the ties between the two nations and the gravity of the claim, DUBAWA deemed it necessary to verify Nimely’s claim of a ‘Vote of no confidence’ by parliament in Ken Ofori-Atta of Ghana.VerificationAccording to the Mariam Dictionary, a vote of no confidence is a formal vote by which members of the Legislature or similar deliberative bodies indicate that they no longer support a leader.Contrary to the claim by Nimely that the “Upper and Lower Houses” in Ghana called for a vote, only one chamber called for a vote of censure against the Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta. Ghana has a unicameral legislature with only one chamber, not a bicameral legislature with two chambers.BackgroundGhana’s Finance Minister, Mr Ken Ofori-Atta, has supervised economic hardship with inflation at 40%, triggering protests and forcing the country to return to the IMF for assistance.In a conversation on the radio in Liberia, Dominic Nimely, a Liberian entrepreneur, claimed that due to the Economic woes under Ofori-Atta’s watch, members of the Ghanaian parliament passed a vote of no confidence against him in 2022. He made the specific statement around 2:44:40 sec of the show that lasted for 3:36 Sec. on Wednesday, June 7, 2023Mr Ofori-Atta had become hugely unpopular due to harsh economic conditions in Ghana and, more importantly, the decision by the government to go to the IMF for a bailout. He had early on sworn that Ghana would never go to the IMF.When the government made a U-turn and went to the IMF, the minister’s popularity fell to the extent that some of his party’s members in the Parliament called for his resignation.After a meeting with the president, Nana Akufo-Addo, the aggrieved MPs softened their stance when the president told them to hold on to their request until after the Minister’s successful engagement with the IMF.Just when the dust was about to settle, the minority members filed a motion of censure against the Finance Minister to force his exit from the government. The minority members accused the minister of conflict of interest and incompetence, among other breaches. Numbering 137 in Parliament, the minority was hoping to get the aggrieved members of the majority MPs to back their call for a vote of no confidence against the minister.The minister was hauled before an ad-hoc committee of Parliament to investigate the allegations contained in the vote of censure, after which the matter was brought to a vote on the floor of Parliament.Contrary to claims by Nimely that the vote of censure succeeded, credible media reports in Ghana and international media reports say otherwise. For instance, Citinewsroom.com and Graphic.com.gh, some of Ghana’s credible online platforms, reported that the vote failed.Also, ‘Reuters’ reported on December 8, 2022, that a bid to Censure Ghana’s finance minister failed in parliament.The BBC, in one of its pidgin articles in December 2022, published with a bold banner headline that reads: “Vote to remove Ghana Finance Minister fail after majority lawmakers walk out from parliament.”At the same time, the Blomberg news outlet reported that the Finance Minister survived the ‘Vote of no Confidence’. Though minority lawmakers voted to remove the Finance Minister, the vote needed two-thirds of the ballot to succeed.As of June 8, 2023, Mr Ken Ofori-Atta remains the Finance Minister of Ghana, having survived the onslaught of a vote of censure.ConclusionAccording to DUBAWA’s research, it is false to claim that Ghanaian parliament members put a vote of no confidence against their Minister of Finance.",15/06/2023,https://dubawa.org/nimelys-assertion-ghanaian-mps-passed-vote-of-no-confidence-against-finance-minister-false/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Weah did not win every election in Grand Bassa County,Varney Dukuly,"Claim: George Weah had won every other election in Grand Bassa County in the absence of Counselor Charles Brumskine (now deceased), said Assistant Minister Esiaka Sheriff.Verdict: Mostly False. “In 2005, former President Sirleaf defeated Mr Weah in the run-up elections. The claimant, however, could not cite additional elections apart from 2017.”Full TextAssistant Internal Affairs Minister Esiaka Sheriff has paid glowing tribute to the electoral fortunes of incumbent president George Weah, who is seeking re-election in the upcoming polls in October.Speaking on OK Morning Rush on May 29, 2023, Mr Sheriff said Mr Weah’s electoral victory in Grand Bassa County, the southern part of the country, is impressive.The conversation, which brought together other opposition members, was to discuss, among other things, who wins Grand Bassa County and why the incumbent president, Weah, should be given another six-year mandate by the people of Liberia.Sharing his perspective, Mr Sheriff told the platform that the President has a better chance of winning Grand Bassa County. His reason was that Counselor Charles Brumskine, a major opposition leader and founder of the Liberty Party and a dominant force in Grand Bassa County, is now late.He went on to say that, but for the presence of Counselor Charles Brumskine and the electoral defeat in 2011, Weah had won Grand Bassa County in every Presidential run-off election.He was convinced that not even the selection of Charlyne Brumskine, daughter of the fallen Bassa hero, as running mate to Mr Alexander Cummings of the opposition CPP could affect the electoral fortunes of President Weah in Grand Bassa County.He made the particular statement around the 57:25sec of the interview, which lasted for over two hours.Grand Bassa County is one of the three original counties that formed the Republic of Liberia. It is the home of the Bassa people from where the late Counselor Brumskine hailed. Until his death, he was popular in the Grand Bassa County elections.But is it true that except for the 2011 elections as well as the presence of Counselor Charles Brumskine, President George Weah would have won every other election in Grand Bassa County? Given the interest and controversy the claim has generated, DUBAWA decided to interrogate the issue.VerificationData from Liberia’s National Elections Commission shows that apart from 2011, President Weah had lost some elections in the Grand Bassa County. So DUBAWA reached out to Mr Sheriff for some clarity on the claim, but he did not respond, as can be seen below;Image source: WhatsAppDUBAWA assessed and scrutinised results from the National Elections Commission in Liberia. The data shows that even though President Weah won the Grand Bassa County in the Presidential run-off election in 2017, accumulating 74.69%, he lost the Grand Bassa County in the 2005 election. In that election, ex-president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf flogged the global soccer legend in the same county in the run-off election. Statistics from the election house indicated that Mr Weah lost to Madam Sirleaf.Also in 2020, during the midterm senatorial election in Liberia, specifically in Grand Bassa County, President Weah, who supported his then Foreign Minister Gbehzongar Milton Findley, could not deliver Grand Bassa.Results from NEC revealed that the county was won by Senator Nyonblee Karnga Lawrence, who ran on the late Counselor Charles Brumskine Liberty Party ticket.ConclusionApart from 2011, President Weah has won every election in Grand Bassa County and the 2017 run-off election. Therefore, the claim is mostly false!",08/06/2023,https://dubawa.org/weah-did-not-win-every-election-in-grand-bassa-county/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Koijee’s claim all opposition members are former government officials, false",Varney Dukuly,"Claim: “The current opposition [members] are all former government officials,” said Jefferson Koijee, the Mayor of Monrovia and Secretary of Mr Weah’s Congress for Democratic Change.Verdict: False. Checks by DUBAWA and interviews with some opposition members indicate that not all have been in government.Full TextMonrovia’s Mayor Jefferson Koijee has told a gathering of intellectuals that the current opposition seeking to dethrone incumbent President Weah are all former government officials.The Mayor’s statement comes in the wake of opposition slogans that Liberia needs to be “rescued” from the hands of Mr Weah.But Mr Koijee questioned the authenticity of the different slogans claiming that the opposition members are former government officials who had the opportunity to serve but failed to deliver the country at the time of service.“Look at the current opposition; they are all former government officials. When we were in opposition, we never had former government [officials in] opposition,” said the Mayor.With five months to go for the October 10 Presidential and Legislative elections, the message for votes is taking diverse trends. The Mayor’s video has since attracted varied opinions.Given his place as Mayor and his role in the country's governance structure, his words and comments are important in the lead-up to the election. DUBAWA decided to investigate if all the opposition members were once government officials.VerificationMayor Koijee, the Secretary of the Congress for Democratic Change, a constituent party within the ruling Coalition, made the statement on Saturday, May 27, 2023, at an ‘Intellectual Center.’ He made the particular claim around the 28 mins of his assertion that spanned for 31:53sec.Government officials are people elected or appointed to administer a government. Like the “Vocabulary Dictionary,” the Free Dictionary shares the same definition.Why is the claim important to investigate?To serve in government is to be allowed to improve the lives of citizens. If the claim by Mayor Koijee is true, then it means all the opposition members who now seek to govern once had the opportunity to improve the people's lives but failed to do so.So DUBAWA decided to investigate if the claim was true.When contacted, some members of the opposition community in Liberia rejected the claim from the Mayor of Monrovia and the Secretary of the CDC.Nelsco Wolo, National Vice Chairman for Mobilization and Recruitment of the Opposition Movement for Democracy and Reconstruction (MDR), is a party headed by Senator Jeremiah Koung, now a running mate to Amb. Joseph Boakai of the Unity Party clarified that he has not worked in government.In a conversation with ‘DUBAWA’, he said: “I am not a former government official; for me, I haven't been a government official. The Mayor should be able to define his motive behind the statement.”The opposition Unity Party National Vice Chair for Inter-Party Relations and National Elections Commission Affairs, Cornelius Kruah-Togba, in a conversation with DUBAWA, also clarified that she was neither appointed nor elected by the President nor the electorate and can, therefore, not be said to have worked in government before.Another opposition leader, Aloysius Toe, the Secretary General of the Collaborating Political Parties (CPP), said the claim that all opposition members are former government members is untrue.“Alexander Cummings, the leader of the CPP, has not served as a government official. I am Aloysius Toe. I am the secretary of the CPP. I have not worked in government since my existence,” said Toe.The Mayor, however, declined to substantiate his claim against the opposition members despite efforts by DUBAWA to get him to substantiate his claim.:ConclusionThe claim by the Mayor of Monrovia that all members of the opposition in Liberia are all former governments is false!

"Unity Party exited government with 12.4% inflation, not 30% in 2017",Varney Dukuly,"Claim: “When the Unity Party was exiting in 2017, inflation was 30%,” said Randall Dobayou, a stalwart of the CDC and Deputy Director for the Environmental Protection Agency.Verdict: False. “Inflation did not hit 30% in 2017, as asserted by the speaker. Data from the World Bank, IMF and others suggest 12.44%.”Full TextThe debate surrounding the best platform to transform the country has taken centre stage on major radio platforms across Liberia as the crucial October 10 Presidential and Legislative elections draw closer.One such argument among Liberian politicians is the issue of how the economy has been managed so far and how the winner of the upcoming elections can consolidate the gains made.A stalwart of the ruling establishment and deputy director for the Environmental Protection Service, Randall Dobayou, said one of the track records of the Weah administration had been macro-economic stability.“We all saw in this country the Unity Party exit. The inflation was at 30%. Today, according to the IMF and World Bank report, inflation is 7%. So for the economy, we have already taken giant steps,” said Dobayou as he argues Weah’s government's priority on the OK Conversation show with two other opposition members.He made these statements during the show on Monday, May 29, 2023, just around 46 mins of the program. The claimant responded directly to a question about the government's major concerns and how unique the CDC ticket is compared to others.Due to the weight of the claim and its biting effects on citizens, DUBAWA has seen the need to fact-check the statement.VerificationInflation is a term that we use to describe rising prices. It also reflects the annual percentage change in the cost of goods and services. The consumer price index usually measures it.Before Weah’s election in 2017, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Havard-trained economist, presided over the country's leadership. According to world bank data, inflation in 2017 stood at 12.4%.Also, the International Monetary Fund data for Liberia’s inflation indicate that in 2017 the inflation rate was 12.4%.Other data sources like ‘Statista’, macrotrends have on their separate websites 12.44% and 12.42 as Liberia’s inflation rate for the year 2017.However, Checks by DUBAWA indicate that Liberia’s current inflation is 6.9 or 7%.ConclusionFindings show that the assertion that Liberia's inflation was 30% in 2017 is false.",02/06/2023,https://dubawa.org/unity-party-exited-government-with-12-4-inflation-not-30-in-2017/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
False! Senator Karnga-Lawrence not part of 19 others who endorsed Amb. Boakai in 2017,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: Eugene Lenn Nagbe, Liberia Maritime Authority (LMA) boss and Chairman of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) Special Committee for Strategy and Engagement, has alleged that “Senator Nyonblee Karnga-Lawrence was part of the 19 lawmakers who endorsed Amb. Joseph Nyumah Boakai in 2017.”Verdict: False! Ms Karnga-Lawrence was not part of the 19 senators who endorsed Amb. Joseph Nyumah Boakai in 2017 because, at that time, the Liberty Party had a Standard bearer in the Presidential race– Charles Walker Brumskine.Full TextThe National Elections Commission (NEC) announced the political polls timetable in which campaigns will officially start from August to October 8, 2023. However, with over 140 days to Liberia’s elections, some parties have begun forming political alliances to maximise votes in the upcoming elections.On Sunday, May 14, 2023, the political leader of the opposition Liberty Party (LP) and Senator of Grand Bassa County, Nyonblee Karnga-Lawrence, joined ranks with the Unity Party’s ex-Liberian vice president, Ambassador Joseph Nyumah Boakia.This move which has become the talk of the town ahead of the country’s 4th post-war elections took place in Senator Karnga-Lawrence’s home county, Grand Bassa.What is more interesting about this decision by Ms Karnga-Lawrence is that she was earlier tipped to be the running mate to Mr Boakai. However, the political leader of the Movement for Democracy and Reconstruction (MDR), Senator of Nimba County Jeremiah Koung, was selected instead.Many thought that Ms Karnga-Lawrence would have left the UP standard bearer, Mr Boakia, because the Unity Party political leader dashed her hope of becoming Liberia’s next vice president.However, she did not turn her back on Mr Boakia. Instead, she overwhelmingly endorsed him. In her endorsement speech, she disclosed that several political party leaders reached out to her to be their running mate, including the political leader of the Alternative National Congress (ANC). Still, she turned down the offer, insisting politicians must have a more profound self-examination of trending political events before deciding to collaborate.“What is even more disturbing and unconscionable is that the ANC folks are inclined to believe that the only way we could gain control of LP is to accept the running mate slot, and everything will fall into place. To accept such an offer will demonstrate sheer greed for power on our part, and this will be the less honourable path to tread,” she stated.Barely three days after she endorsed the candidature of the Unity Party’s ticket, Liberia Maritime Authority (LMA) boss and Chairman of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) Special Committee for Strategy and Engagement, Lenn Eugene Nagbe, appeared on the state-owned media house, the Liberia Broadcasting System or ELBC to criticise her decision.Lenn Eugen NagbeMr Nagbe alleged that “Ms Karnga-Lawrence was part of the 19 senators who endorsed ex-vice president Boakia during the 2017 presidential and legislative elections in the country,” and President Weah defeated them.The ruling CDC Strategy and Engagement chairman indicated that Ms Karnga-Lawrence's endorsement this time would mean no threat to the re-election bid of President George Weah.Mr Nagbe said, “You have endorsed this one man over five times, and you still think it comes with value?”He added that Mr Weah would still beat them despite the endorsement.Mr Nagbe made this claim 44: to 45:10 minutes/seconds of an over one hour-forty minute show. The presentation was live on the institution's official Facebook page with 7,000 views and 400 comments. Other online platforms like Dtv Online and Front Page Africa shared the presentation.VerificationPolitical alliances are not new in Liberia, especially when elections are beckoning. However, is it true that Ms Karnga-Lawrence was among the 19 senators who endorsed Joseph Nyumah Boakai?DUBAWA investigated the assertion due to the interest it has generated so far.To begin with, DUBAWA reached out to Mr Nagbe to provide evidence for his claim, but he is yet to respond, as evident in the WhatsApp conversation below.Further checks by DUBAWA showed that in 2017, 19 senators formed an alliance and endorsed the then vice president, who was contesting for the presidency on the ticket of the Unity Party, but Ms Karnga-Lawrence was not one of them.DUBAWA also reached out to Ms Karnga-Lawrence to inquire whether she was in the group of the 19 senators who endorsed the candidature of Amb. Joseph Boakai in 2017.Ms Karnga-Lawrence told DUBAWA that she could not have been a member of the 19 senators because she was part of the campaign team of the Liberty Party headed by the late Charles Walker Brumskine in Grand Bassa County.She said, “How could I have done so when I was the head of Brumskine’s campaign in the Grand Bassa belt during the first round? The senators didn’t endorse in secret; they had a program?”Ms Karnga-Lawrence, however, told DUBAWA that she did not make a public statement during the second round of the elections to endorse Amba. Joseph Boakai, but she did vote for him.Here are screenshots from the WhatsApp conversation between Ms Karnga-Lawrence and DUBAWA in the pictures belowConclusionBased on research conducted by DUBAWA and the facts available, the claim made by Nagbe is false.",26/05/2023,https://dubawa.org/false-senator-karnga-lawrence-not-part-of-19-others-who-endorsed-amb-boakai-in-2017/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
False! Police vehicle arrested with drugs in presidential convoy was in 2010,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: A presidential candidate in Liberia, Cllr. Tiawan Gongloe claims, ""Three years ago, a presidential vehicle was caught smuggling drugs, and nothing came out of it.”Verdict: False! Ten years ago, a vehicle within the presidential convoy was arrested for smuggling drugs.Full TextAs elections draw closer in Liberia, politicians have started to make dozens of promises, allegations and counter-allegations.Counselor Tiawon Gongloe, a presidential candidate in Liberia's impending October presidential and legislative elections, is not holding back with his allegations.Photo source: Google image, Cllr. Taiwan Gongloe.Appearing on a local radio show, the “Spoon Talk,” aired on Spoon FM/TIV, Counselor Gongloe pulled no punches in his criticism of President Weah’s commitment to fighting drugs in Liberia. He alleged, ""Three years ago, a presidential vehicle was caught smuggling drugs, and nothing came out of it.”He repeated the same allegation on two other radio stations, FABRIC and Super FM/TV stations.Counselor Gongloe’s comments were in response to a question asked by one of the show's panellists about the issue of drugs in the country and how he would address it if he becomes the country’s next president after the October polls.The standard bearer of the Liberia People Party (LPP), Counselor Tiawan Gongloe, asserted that drugs in Liberia are creating many criminals, and as such, they should be addressed holistically.Counselor Gongloe said,“The issue of drugs in the country has increased the criminal behaviour of a lot of young people, and not just in Monrovia but all over the country, so we have to be strong on law enforcement, improve the economy but also have to be strong on those who bring drugs in the country. It is connected to people at the top level of government. Why do I say so? Because three years ago, a presidential escort car was caught with drugs in it at Bo-Waterside, it was so embarrassing, and that case did not go anywhere.”The show was live on the station's official Facebook page with over 20k viewers, 3.6k comments, over 760 emojis and 414 shares.The Liberian presidential aspirant claimed at 1:17:00-35 hours/minutes/seconds.The issues of drugs in Liberia are increasing to the extent that the national government, in partnership with the United Nations, launched a US$ 13M project to get drug users off the streets and empower them.At some point, the Liberian leader, President George Weah, blamed parents for allowing their kids to get onto the streets to peddle drugs and become addicted.Recently, with the advent of a new drug, Kush, in the county, young people fall prey to this substance daily.It can be recalled that the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), Major General Prince C Johnson III, suggested that there should be a national drug test for all public officials, and it should be mandatory as a prerequisite for holding public office in the country.Despite the increasingly worrying situation about illicit drugs in Liberia, is it true that illegal drugs were found in a presidential convoy three years ago?VerificationIt is important to fact-check this claim because it highlights the growing impunity of drug use in Liberia and attempts to incriminate high-ranking Liberian officials in the illegal drug trade.Moreso, with the polls five months away, it is important to verify critical national issues concerning security and drugs in the country. DUBAWA, therefore, feels obliged to look into this claim.To begin with, DUBAWA first reached out to the claimant, Counselor Tiawan Gongloe, to inquire about him the source or evidence of his claim, but he did not respond, as can be seen in the WhatsApp screenshots below.DUBAWA then embarked on an investigative journey to ascertain the claim made by presidential hopeful Tiawan Gongloe in Liberia’s upcoming elections.It was discovered that in 2013, ten years ago, under the then administration of former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Perry Dolo, the Driver of ‘escort 1’, a police vehicle that led the convoy of the then President, was arrested with drugs in it.This story was widely reported by media institutions both locally and internationally, as seen here and here.DUBAWA also tried a Google search to see if the claim by Tiawan Gongloe would find expression in any media report in the last three years but found nothing.ConclusionBased on facts backed by various international and local media, the claim made by Counselor Tiawan Gongloe is false.",23/05/2023,https://dubawa.org/false-police-vehicle-arrested-with-drugs-in-presidential-convoy-was-in-2010/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
False! Senator Johnson won more than 50% of total registered votes in Nimba County,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: Abu Sherif, a Liberian journalist, claimed, “Prince Johnson Could not Get at least 50% of the total Registered Votes in Nimba County.Verdict: False! “Senator Prince Johnson won more than 50% of the total registered votes in Nimba County.Full TextWith less than six months to Liberia’s presidential and legislative elections, there are alignments, realignments, and cross-carpeting of politicians in the country.The latest is Nimba County, Senator Prince Y. Johnson, who has defected from the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) to the opposition Unity Party.In 2017, Senator Prince Y. Johnson supported the then-opposition Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) and pledged the support of Nimba County to the CDC but has since disclosed that he regrets his action.It seems the relationship has gone sour between both parties, with Senator Prince Johnson accusing the CDC-led administration of a plot to assassinate him.The Nimba County Senator is the founding father of the opposition Movement for Democracy and Reconstructions (MDR), now in a political marriage with the Unity Party of former Vice President of Liberia, Amb. Joseph Nyumah Boakai.Before defecting to the Unity Party, Senator Johnson is on record to have attacked the former Liberian vice president, taunting him to retire from politics in the country, as seen here.There have been mixed reactions to the Senator’s decision to defect to the Unity Party.Abu Sherif, a Liberian journalist and a radio talk show host on “The Freedom Morning Rise,” aired on Freedom FM/TV, has been critical of Senator Johnson’s decision.According to him, Senator Johnson should not be taken seriously.Journalist Abu Sherif.On the May 10, 2023, edition of his show, he claimed that the Nimba County Senator could not be regarded as the godfather of the county because he could not even get at least 50% of the total registered votes in Nimba County.The show was live on the institution's official Facebook page with over 60 comments, 30 shares, 65 emojis and 1.2k views.Abu Sherif claimed at 1:32:20 – 42 hours/minutes/seconds.Abu acknowledged that though Senator Johnson supported the CDC in 2017, his support did not add anything to the victory of President Weah. He described Senator Johnson as a liability to the CDC because of his track record of being a warlord.Abu added, “Prince is not the godfather of Nimba; the number does not say that. Prince Johnson did not bring anything in terms of numbers to George Weah, and he is not taking anything from George Weah because he still struggles to maintain his over one hundred thousand votes.”Senator Prince Johnson is a former warlord in Liberia who participated in the country’s civil unrest that lasted for over 14 years but is now a Senator of Nimba County, the largest county in the country. He is also regarded as the county’s political godfather.Senator Prince Johnson is currently under sanction by the United States government, which has since blacklisted him.Based on the importance of the claim made by journalist Abu Sherif and the controversy it has generated so far ahead of the elections, DUBAWA feels obligated to verify the claim.VerificationIn 2017, while serving as Senator of Nimba County, Senator Prince Johnson contested for the country’s highest office, the Presidency. He came fourth with 127,666 votes amounting to 8% in the country.In Nimba, where Senator Prince Johnson hails from and serves as its seated Senator, he came first among the 20 presidential candidates with 107,430 votes constituting 53.5% of the total registered voters in the county. There were 214,200 total votes, 200,791 were valid votes, and 13,409 were invalid votes in the county.DUBAWA also reached out to the claimant to establish the exact context in which he made the claim.Sherif said, “I was talking to Nimba as a community of nation beyond the political borders of Nimba County. However, when the senator claims he's the godfather of the people, my point was in such capacity 50% of support is insufficient and that at least a 60-70% claim would suffice.”Here are screenshots between DUBAWA and Sherif.ConclusionFollowing the research conducted by DUBAWA and based on the facts available on the website of the National Elections Commission of Liberia (NEC), the radio talk show host's claim made against Senator Prince Johnson is false",17/05/2023,https://dubawa.org/false-senator-johnson-won-more-than-50-of-total-registered-votes-in-nimba-county/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
False! Unity Party Secretary General Amos Tweh did not announce that Ex-VP Boakai will pick Senator Jeremiah Koung,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: “Amos Tweh has just announced that Boakai would pick Jeremiah Koung on Friday, April 28,” Shine Liberia Blog posted.Verdict: False! Unity Party Secretary General Amos Tweh did not announce that Ex-VP Boakai will pick Senator Jeremiah Koung as a running mate on Friday, April 28, 2023.Full TextWith elections beckoning later this year, Liberians both at home and abroad have been yearning for the selection of the running mate of the former Vice President of Liberia and now the standard bearer of the immediate past ruling Unity Party, Ambassador Joseph Nyumah Boakia.There were reports that he was expected to pick a running mate soon, but no such appointment has been made, at least officially.The Daily Observer has named several prominent Liberians, including Grand Bassa County Senator Nyonblee Karnga Lawrence, Nimba County Senator Jeremiah Koung, and political talk show host Henry Costa as possible contenders for selection by the Unity Party’s standard bearer.Late Thursday evening, however, Shine Liberia blog posted on its official page that the Secretary General of the opposition Unity Party (UP), Amos Tweh, has announced that the party’s standard bearer, Ex-Liberian Vice President Ambassador Joseph Nyumah Boakai will on Friday, April 28, 2023, pick Nimba County Senator and political leader of the Movement for Democracy and Reconstruction (MDR), Jeremiah Koung as running mate.This post came shortly after the Unity Party Secretary, Amos Tweh, appeared on a local talk show, ‘Spoon Talk,’ aired on Spoon FM/TV to make some pronouncement.VerificationDue to this claim's essential nature concerning the country’s legislative and presidential elections slated for October this year, DUBAWA feels obligated to verify the claim.To begin with, DUBAWA first contacted the claimant, “Shine Liberia Blog,” via WhatsApp through its owner, Teage George, for evidence of its claim. However, the blogger has since refused to respond to DUBAWA’s inquiry, as seen in the screenshots below.DUBAWA also contacted the Unity Party’s Secretary General, Amos Tweh, via WhatsApp concerning the claim. Tweh referred DUBAWA to his appearance on Spoon Talk late Thursday, April 20, 2023, and told DUBAWA that he made no such comments, as seen below.DUBAWA then visited the Spoon FM/TV page to monitor the interview Mr Tweh was involved in.Mr Tweh said on the show that on Friday, April 28, 2023, his party would make known the name of the running mate to its standard bearer, Ex-Liberian Vice President Joseph Nyumah Boakai. He did not mention the name of the person to be selected.Tweh disclosed at the 43-44:00-30 minutes/seconds of the over two hours show.The show had 17k views, 4.6k comments and over 650 emojis, and this show is being widely followed by Liberians both at home and abroad.Tweh said, “I know that this has been a concern for many in public about what is the next step for Ambassador Joseph Nyumah Boakai, when is the old man going to name his running mate. My task tonight is not to call the name of an individual because that responsibility squarely rests on Joseph Nyumah Boakai, but what I have come to say to you on this platform and to our Liberian people at large is that all is now set for the announcement of JNB running mate on Friday, April 28, 2023.”DUBAWA also visited the official Facebook page of the Unity Party Secretary General, Amos Tweh. It was discovered that he had made a post this “Friday, April 28, 2023, at the National Headquarters of Unity Party on Broad Street” without mentioning the name of the person expected to be picked.ConclusionBased on all of the investigations conducted by DUBAWA, it is untrue that the Unity Party Secretary General, Amos Tweh, announced that Boakai would pick Jeremiah Koung as the vice presidential candidate on Friday, April 28th.",26/04/2023,https://dubawa.org/false-unity-party-secretary-general-amos-tweh-did-not-announce-that-ex-vp-boakai-will-pick-senator-jeremiah-koung/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Foreign diplomats and local politics: The case of Michael McCarthy, U.S. Ambassador to Liberia",Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"On March 27, 2023, the White House announced a new US Ambassador to Liberia, Mark Christopher Toner.Mr Tober is to replace Mr Michael McCarthy, who has only been in office since January 22, 2021.The announcement of Mr Toner as the new United States Ambassador to Liberia has sparked a new wave of controversy among Liberians.Many believe that Mr McCarthy is the shortest-ever Ambassador to have served in Liberia and are quick to accuse him of meddling.A Liberian blog, Shine Liberia, triggered this conversation, asserting that Mr McCarthy is the shortest-serving US ambassador to Liberia.He further stated that the Weah government is not happy with Michael McCarthy’s style of diplomacy in Liberia. Also, a chronicle of diplomatic exchanges between the McCarthy-led US Embassy in Liberia and agents of the Liberian government will bear testimony.DUBAWA looks at some of these exchanges and how they may have played a role in McCarthy’s relatively short stint as US Ambassador to Liberia.The announcement of Mark Christopher Toner as the new Ambassador to Liberia comes on the heels of President George Weah’s recent visit to the United States.On March 17, 2023, President George Weah departed Liberia for an official visit to the United States and The United Arab Emirates but did not disclose the details of the visit.There are claims that President Weah and the government of Liberia may have had a hand in withdrawing Mr McCarthy from Monrovia. The timing between the announcement of the new Ambassador and Weah’s visit to the US is all too striking.Why do Liberians think President Weah influenced Ambassador McCarthy’s replacement?In November last year, the United States Ambassador issued a statement warning the Liberian government and Liberians, in general, to avoid doing business with officials of the Liberian government who have been sanctioned for corruption.In that statement, Ambassador McCarthy reminded the Liberian citizens that anyone who transacted any form of business with these sanctioned individuals “may themselves be exposed to sanctions or subject to an enforcement action.”On March 15, 2022, during the last year's birth anniversary celebration of the first Liberian President, Joseph J. Roberts, Ambassador McCarthy expressed frustration over how the country is being led under President Weah. He noted that despite huge contributions made by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to the health and other sectors of the country, the country’s development is not impressive.  Ambassador McCarthy also stressed the filthiness of the city of Monrovia under the Mayor-ship of the CDC general secretary, Jefferson Koijii, a statement the Monrovia City Mayor found offensive.With the support of the CDC government, the Mayor issued a rejoinder to the US ambassador, as seen here and here.Recently, the former US Ambassador again stated that the National Elections Commission (NEC) must be fully funded for Liberia to have a fair and transparent electoral process.McCarthy's assertion resulted from calls made by the National Elections Commission (NEC) over funds not yet released to conduct the country’s Presidential and legislative polls in October this year.On December 9, 2022, Ambassador McCarthy again wrote an open letter to the Liberian government, highlighting that though the United States was not announcing any more sanctions against corrupt Liberian officials, its anti-corruption efforts against Liberia will continue and remain robust.The letter, in part, reads: “Even though we are announcing no new U.S. sanctions here today, I want to assure the Liberian people that our anti-corruption efforts remain robust and continuous. As the Global Magnitsky sanctions of three Liberian officials in August demonstrated, the U.S. government can and will employ sanctions as needed on an ongoing basis to support our shared development, democracy, and security goals, guided by the U.S. Strategy on Countering Corruption.”After a chain of similar events and protestations by some Liberians, it did not take too long a time for the US government to announce a new Ambassador.How long did the US Ambassador spend in Liberia before his replacement?According to Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution, the Senate is responsible for confirming that all presidential appointees and ambassadors are no exception.After a person is nominated by the US President, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations conducts a rigorous scrutiny process and public hearings to check the nominee’s personal and financial backgrounds and determine their suitability for the job.From research and the time interval between previous U.S. ambassadors to Liberia since the end of the country’s civil war, it has been mostly three years and not more than five years.Terms of Past US Ambassadors to LiberiaSince post-war, Liberia has had at least four Ambassadors. They are Ambassadors Linda Thomas Greenfield, who served the US from August 2008 to February 29, 2012; Deborah R. Malac, from September 20, 2012, to December 18, 2015; and Christine A. Elder, from June 23, 2016, to March 21, 2020. Michael McCarthy served from January 22, 2021, until the US Senate can confirm the newly named ambassador to come to Liberia and take over officially.AmbassadorsYear In OfficeYear OutMonths1Linda Thomas-GreenfieldAugust 2008February 29, 201254 Months2Deborah R.

While it is true the Weah government was not happy with Mr McCarthy’s alleged interference in the local politics of Liberia, there is no evidence to suggest the outgoing Ambassador was recalled due to pressure from the Liberia government led by George Weah.",21/04/2023,https://dubawa.org/foreign-diplomats-and-local-politics-the-case-of-michael-mccarthy-u-s-ambassador-to-liberia/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inquirer Newspaper Managing Editor’s statement that radio invention precedes newspaper is untrue!,Gloria Wleh,"Claim: The Managing Editor of the Inquirer Newspaper claimed that “radio was the first before newspapers came about.”Verdict: False. A BBC report shows the radio was invented in the 1800s, while other credible reports show the first newspaper was made in the 1600s.Full TextThe Managing Editor of the Inquirer Newspaper, Christiana Jimmy, appeared as a guest on World Radio Day, on a famous early morning radio show, The OK Morning Rush on OK FM in Monrovia.When quizzed by the host, Madam Jimmy said, “As to what extent do you think radio is impacting the world,” she responded, “Radio is impacting the world at a very significant speed.” She added that “radio was the first before newspaper came about.”Her response which spanned from 1:41:40-1:41:52, attracted lots of responses from the online and offline audience of the show, given that she and the other guests are popular and influential voices within the Liberian media landscape.Ironically, in the interview, Madam Jimmy cautioned journalists and media practitioners to be careful of what they say on the radio because the medium has a wide reach. She also added that the caution is due to how journalists play an instrumental role in information dissemination.Based on the comments made by Madam Jimmy, DUBAWA decided to set the records straight on the history of mass communication to discover which of the inventions came first, the radio or newspapers.VerificationThe history of mass communication is a common subject of interest to many journalists, fact-checkers, and mass communicators. Several authorities have written for decades about how the various mass communication technologies have evolved and how each has impacted the generation, as seen here, here and here.Hearing Christiana Jimmy say the radio came before the newspaper was curious. DUBAWA contacted Madame Winnie Jimmy, also the Vice President of the Female Journalists Association of Liberia (FeJAL),) to ask for the source of her claim.She referenced UKEasy's July 26, 2021 work ‘Radio as a Medium of Mass Communication,’ from which she sent screenshots of portions of the work via a messenger chat exchange, among which she specifically highlighted a part that reads: “Radio was the first truly mass medium of communication, reaching millions’.Highlighted screenshot from Madam JimmyThe UKEssays’ work Madam Jimmy referenced states a disclaimer: ""Any opinions, findings, conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of UKEssays.com.”Is radio truly the first mass communication tool to reach millions of people?It is common knowledge that mass communication started with the introduction of the printing press, giving birth to newspapers. Johannes Gutenberg, credited with the printing press and newspapers, served several thousand readers even before radio as a medium of mass communication.Again, Sutori, a popular US-based website, shows that the first newspaper was made in the 1600s. Before the invention of the newspaper, the site furthered the handwritten news sheets circulated widely in Vincennes as early as 1556.Whereas newspapers emerged in the 1600s, the radio was invented in 1800.A report from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) showed that in the early 1860s, the Scottish physicist, James Clerk Maxwell, derived four equations that together describe the behaviour of electricity and magnetism. They predicted the existence of a previously unknown phenomenon: electromagnetic waves. These waves were first observed in the early 1880s, and over the next two decades, a succession of scientists and engineers built increasingly elaborate devices to produce and detect them. Eventually, this gave birth to a new technology: radio. The report further noted that the Italian Guglielmo Marconi is commonly described as the father of radio.According to the National Inventors Hall of Fame, Guglielmo Marconi invented the radio in 1895 and transmitted electrical signals through the air. The experiences were, in effect, the dawn of practical radio.ConclusionChecks from the BBC and other sources show that the newspaper was invented in the 1600s. In comparison, the radio came about in the 1800s, and the claim from the Inquirer Newspaper Managing Editor that “radio was the first before newspaper came about” is untrue.”The researcher produced this explainer per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship in partnership with The Stage Media – Liberia, to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.”",14/04/2023,https://dubawa.org/inquirer-newspaper-managing-editors-statement-that-radio-invention-precedes-newspaper-is-untrue/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

US Envoy’s comment about disinformation from some Liberians in US not fake?,Varney Dukuly,"Claim: “The purported letter from U.S Ambassador McCarthy accusing Liberians in the USA of spreading information is fake,” says activist Martin K.N. KollieVerdict: False. The letter is not purported, it is real, and the link is on the US Embassy Facebook page. In addition, the US Ambassador near Monrovia on Tuesday, March 14, 2023, voiced the accusation against Liberians with reporters.Full TextLiberians residing in the United States who were noted for using the traditional media or radio stations back home to spew allegations were shocked after the US embassy openly debunked their actions.The US envoy in Liberia said most of the controversies emerging in Liberian media ahead of the elections originated from the United States.“Today, I am ashamed to tell you that the most irresponsible controversies to emerge in Liberia’s media over the past month have originated from the United States. While responsible critical observations from the Liberian diaspora can be healthy, some cowardly media personalities and political personalities have intentionally disseminated rumours or misinformation into Liberia’s political environment from the safety of their studios and offices in the U.S.,” Ambassador McCarthy said in his opening remarks with the anti-corruption coordinators.His statement comes on the heels of allegations by persons based in the US that City Mayor of Monrovia, Jefferson Koijee, masterminded the killing of former Chief Justice's daughter, Charloe Musu, by sponsoring a City police officer, Varlee Telleh, who is an ex-fighter for former President Charles Taylor during Liberia’s civil crisis.Liberian lawyer Jerome Verdier, currently residing in the US, made this particular allegation. He was also the online guest panellist on the SpoonTalk show.The Mayor, who was accused of masterminding the murder, has, through his legal team, challenged Verdier to provide evidence to authenticate his claim to help the Police force with an ongoing investigation.Verdier is not the only person known for trading allegations and disinformation. Martin Kollie, who also resides in the diaspora but is vocal on local issues in Liberia, is known to have traded some false news as well, one of which was investigated by DUBAWA.For example, his claim about the doctor to patients ratio in the country was found to be palpably false after DUBAWA ‘Fact-Checked the claim. Attached is the report.In discussing the issue raised by Liberia’s US Ambassador about disinformation from Liberians in the US, Martin Kollie sought to deny there was no such comment by the US Ambassador. He alleged the comment attributed to the US Ambassador was no more than pro-CDC propaganda being shared on Facebook. Kollie’s post, dated March 15, 2023, has generated over two hundred controversial comments, thirty-one shares and 292 Facebook likes and emojis.Though some Facebook commenters disagreed with the claimant under his post, others believed him.VerificationGiven the mention of a prominent diplomat and the significance of the information to Liberia and its biting effects on the nation, DUBAWA decided to verify the post by activist Martin K.N. Kollie.Again, as a result of the controversy generated by Martin Kollie's post, insisting the comment by the Ambassador was non-existent, DUBAWA had every responsibility to verify if the US Ambassador's comment was indeed made.The researcher found a link to the statement made by the US Ambassador, which is on the verified US Embassy Facebook page. In addition, audio recording of Ambassador McCarthy was played during one of the prime shows on OK FM, the “Afternoon Conversation” Ambassador McCarthy, speaking at a news conference recently said,“While responsible critical observations from the Liberian diaspora can be healthy, some cowardly media personalities and political personalities have intentionally disseminated rumours or misinformation about Liberia’s environment from the safety of their studios and offices in the US. These people are motivated by disruption and a desire to break down trust in Liberian institutions- they don’t care what damage they cause. When questioned by law enforcement, they do not have evidence to back up their claims.“Unfortunately, they take advantage of America’s first amendment rights to spread rumours and stir up trouble in your country, which is despicable behaviour.”Contrary to claims the information could not be accessed on the website of the US Embassy in Monrovia, DUBAWA can confirm it is online.ConclusionFrom the information gathered, it is clear that activist Martin K.N. Kollie lied about the US ambassador's statement about diaspora Liberians spreading false information from the US back home.The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with OK FM to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",03/04/2023,https://dubawa.org/us-envoys-comment-about-disinformation-from-some-liberians-in-us-not-fake/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
President Weah’s Executive Order versus the Liberian Code of Conduct,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"President George Oppong Weah has courted huge controversy in Liberia after he demanded the resignations of public officers and appointees who have ambitions to contest in the upcoming elections.The action by the president is backed by Liberia’s code of conduct that is expected to guide the actions of public officers.Given the controversy this decision has generated, DUBAWA has decided to explore the history of the code of ethics in Liberia and its role in guiding public officials' conduct.History of the Code of EthicsSince the introduction of the Code of Conduct of Liberia in 2014, there have always been issues with adherence by the public, while appointed government officials have always had issues with adherence.During the 2017 Presidential and Legislative elections, the National Elections Commission stopped an aspirant, Abu Kamara, from contesting the election in Montserrado County District #15 because he did not meet the requirement of the Code of Conduct to contest. The country’s Supreme Court upheld this NEC position when the aspirant ran to court.In 2022, the Liberian Legislature amended certain portions of the 2014 Code of Conduct, particularly Part V, sections 5.2 under Political Participation and Part-X 10.2 under Declaration and Registration of Personal Interests, Assets and Performance/Financial Bonds on the grounds that those provisions were too high and unreasonable.Prior to the amendment, section 5.2 states,“Wherein, any person in the category stated in section 5.1 herein above desires to canvass or contest for an elective public position, the following shall apply; a) Any Minister, Deputy Minister, Director-General, Managing Director and Superintendent appointed by the President pursuant to Article 56 (a) of the Constitution and a Managing Director appointed by a Board of Directors, who desires to contest for elective public office shall resign said post at least two (2) years prior to the date of such public elections.”While 10.2 states, “The declaration of personal interest, income, assets, liabilities and the performance bond as may be required, shall be lodged with 16 ? In the Legislative Branch, with the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives; ? In the Executive Branch, with the General Auditing Commission; and ? In the Judicial Branch with the Clerk of the Supreme Court; and in each event such receipt shall be notified to the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC).”In the amended portion of the code of conduct, Section 5.2 to be precise, public officers who wish to contest elections now have one year instead of two to resign before the next election. The amended portion states: “all officials appointed by the President, including all cabinet ministers, deputy and assistant cabinet ministers, ambassadors, ministers consuls, superintendents of counties and other Government officials, both military and civilian, appointed by the President pursuant to Article 56(a) of the 1986 Constitution, and any managing director, deputy managing director, assistant managing director of a corporation owned by the Government of Liberia, any commissioner, deputy and assistant commissioner of any commission established by the Legislature, and any official of the Government who negotiates and executes contracts, procures goods and services, and/or manages assets for and on behalf of the Government of Liberia, who desires to canvass or contest for an elective public office within the Government of Liberia shall resign his or her position one (1) year before the date on which the election for the post for which he/she intends to contest.”The amended code is already a subject of controversy.Some believe Section 5.2 of the code is too expensive for people or officials to be affected and does not directly help in the fight against corruption as it purports to do.Others believe 12 months is still too long for people to resign in the hope of contesting the next election, and the possibility of creating chaos and a vacuum in government is high.Be that as it may, the Code was still amended and should fulfil its approved purpose. But did it?The Code and the October ElectionWith barely seven months to the October elections, questions have been asked about public or appointed government officials' adherence to the Code of Conduct. Even more controversial is the directive by the Liberian President, George Manneh Weah, to all appointed officials within his government to resign their posts if they have any desire to contest an elected position during the country’s Presidential and Legislative elections.President Weah’s directive was contained in Executive Order #117, published on the Executive Mansion's official website, on Tuesday, March 14, 2023.The Executive Order complies with the amended Sections 5.2 and 10.2 of the 2014 Code of Conduct enacted, approved and printed into handbills on December 29, 2022.The objective of the President’s Executive Order, as it is with the Code of Conduct, “is to dissociate the fiduciary duty of trust, integrity and loyalty owed by public officials to the people from their desires to contest elections at the expense of public resources.”This Executive Order issued by President Weah has received massive media support, as seen here and here, and has generated controversy in equal measure.If the code requires that public officers need to resign their positions a year before the next election, if they wish to contest, why wait till it’s eight months before the election before issuing an Executive Order? Sections of the public are asking the president.What do Liberians think?Others argue that the President's Executive Order is belated because, according to them, the Code of Conduct says that appointed officials of government should resign one year before the election date. In contrast, others argue that the Liberian leader's Executive Order is in the wrong direction. DUBAWA took its microphone to ordinary Liberians in the streets to engage their views on the matter, and these are what they had to sayFranklin Moses, a Liberian, told DUBAWA that Liberians are just a different set of people who are notorious for breaking laws.“You see how our country is completely the opposite of everything? The law is saying something completely different, and the president is coming with another completely different thing which in my mind is a complete contradiction to what the law says,” Moses notedDaniel S. Sackie, another Liberian down Broad Streets in central Monrovia also told DUBAWA that the President is not wrong to issue the Executive Order because it is still within one year.“I hear people say that President Weah's Executive Order is belated, that’s wrong, and I don’t want to believe that because it is still within the same one-year period. So the President acted in line with the laws,” he said.Cllr. Bornor M Varmah, General Secretary of the Liberia National BAR Association (LNBA) told a local radio show, Okay 99.5FM, that it was wrong to issue an executive order on an already existing law.Cllr. Varmah Made the assertions during the call-in session of the show, and his comments are at 41-44:05 min/sec of the same programme.Cllr. Varmah said that the best thing President Weah should have done was appoint the officials of the Ombudsman instead of issuing an executive order.“If you look at the recent executive order issued by President George Weah, one would say that it was not the right thing to issue an executive order in the face of existing and enforceable law. You are not to issue an executive order when we have laws that are supposed to be enforced on the subject matter that you are placing the executive order on,” he stated.Atty. Kla Edward Toomey II, a Liberian legal practitioner, told DUBAWA that if those wanting to contest elective offices refuse to resign, two things may happen.He stated that the President can dismiss those he believes want to contest in advance or wait to dismiss them after the campaign starts and they are still occupying their positions.Atty. Toomey II added, “the opponents can also file a complaint against them with the court.”What are the affected officials saying?DUBAWA also engaged the views of some appointed officials lacing their boots to contest elective offices in the October presidential and legislative elections.Janjay Baikpeh is the Superintendent of Grand Bassa County and wants to contest in district #2 of the county.Superintendent Baikpeh told local journalists in his county that he would respect the President’s Executive Order and resign within the time frame stipulated within the order.“For us, we will respect the President’s order and call on all other appointed officials who want to contest to do the same. We will resign within the required period,” Superintendent Baikpeh noted.DUBAWA also reached out to other would-be candidates who are currently presidential appointees within the CDC-led government for their position on the President’s executive order, but they failed to respond to our inquiry, as seen in the WhatsApp chat belowThese are inquiries made by DUBAWA to the Port of Sinoe county manager, Alex Noah, the Head of the National Commission on Small Arms, Atty.Maxwell Grisby and the Head of the National Identification Registry, Tiah Nagbe, respectively, refused to respond to DUBAWA. ConclusionThe Code of Conduct is supposed to be an important document to guide the conduct of public officers in Liberia. However, on the evidence of what is happening, public officers are not abiding by the dictates of the Code, and something drastic has to be done to ensure compliance.",30/03/2023,https://dubawa.org/president-weahs-executive-order-versus-the-liberian-code-of-conduct/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DUBAWA to train over 500 journalists in West Africa with Google News Initiative support,Dubawa,"DUBAWA is set to train newsrooms in West Africa on digital journalism, verification, and fact-checking skills in Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and The Gambia.Supported by the Google News Initiative and in partnership with the Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID), DUBAWA aims to positively impact democracy, media performance, media trust, and media sustainability through this capacity-building effort.The first phase of the training project was launched in Nigeria in February, in three states of the Federation; Rivers state, Kano state, and the Federal Capital Territory, before the country’s general elections. Over 100 journalists across the three states in Nigeria were trained on digital verification and fact-checking skills.Subsequent training sessions are scheduled in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and The Gambia between April and June 2023, where journalists in the said countries can apply for the training opportunity.The two-day non-residential boot camp will have three sessions daily, including practical and breakout sessions, with approximately 100 journalists in each country.Kemi Busari, DUBAWA Nigeria editor, who facilitated sessions in Nigeria prior to the country’s general elections, believes the training was timely in curbing the spread of false information.“With digital disruption and other variables, the information ecosystem keeps throwing up challenges, one of which is mis- and disinformation. As journalists, we face different kinds of false information that require updated skills daily. This intervention by DUBAWA is meant to help journalists with the necessary skills to report facts, verify claims, and, consequently, sanitise the information ecosystem. We are grateful to Google for providing such an opportunity at this crucial time,” Busari said.Nathan Gadugah, DUBAWA Ghana editor, also believes that with the upcoming elections in other countries, training journalists will improve the quality of reports they produce.“In an era of mis and disinformation, acquiring the skills and competencies in identifying and combating information disorder is easily the biggest investment any journalist could make. I am happy that through DUBAWA, our fellow journalists will be trained on verification and how to use key fact-checking tools to complement their work,” Gadugah said.This project, supported by the Google News Initiative, helps DUBAWA to fulfil its mandate of improving journalism practice across West Africa.SignedCaroline AnipahDeputy DirectorVerification and Media Literacy PracticeDUBAWA/CJID",27/03/2023,https://dubawa.org/dubawa-to-train-over-500-journalists-in-west-africa-with-google-news-initiative-support/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Misleading to suggest Weah increased Armed Forces of Liberia budget by US$4 million in 2022 fiscal year,Gloria Wleh,"Claim: The Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism (MICAT) claimed that “President George Weah increased the army's budget by US$4 million in FY 2022.”Verdict: Misleading! The FY 2022 national budget shows that the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL)’s budget was increased by US$2,881,211m.Full TextThe Armed Forces of Liberia has historically been to defend and guard the Country’s borders, safeguard national security, and protect the population from external aggression.It became the Armed Forces of Liberia in 1970 from the Liberian National Guard.On January 13, 2023, the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism (MICAT) took to its official Facebook page to highlight the numerous achievements President George Weah made during five years. It was cited that “President George Weah increased the army budget by US$4 million in FY 2022.”Ministry of Information Cultural (MICAT)’s post about the AFL first under section 11, themed: “PUBLIC SAFETY & NATIONAL SECURITY,” attracted 172 reactions, 166 comments and 117 as of March 1, 2023, with commenters having mixed views about the post.But did it mean that MICAT’s post about the army’s budgetary increment was also a great booster to the AFL operations?DUBAWA verified facts surrounding the ministry’s claim and further ascertained what the increment meant for the military.VerificationThe fiscal year (FY) 2022 of the Armed Forces of Liberia (ALF) was examined by DUBAWA, and it revealed that the AFL, which is a department under the direction and supervision of the Ministry of National Defense, was budgetarily allocated US$16,361,844m of the US$18,695,921m the Defense Ministry received that year.To verify the actual figure of the army’s budget was increased in FY 2022, DUBAWA checked the FY 2020-2021, and it shows that the AFL got US$13,480,633m of the US$14,412,445 the Ministry of National Defense received.Also, in 2021, a “Special National Budget, Fiscal Year 2021” was passed, and on that budget, the AFL received US$2,464,633m of the US$7,853,070m that was given to the Defense Ministry.In 2022, the ALF was allocated US$16,361,844m of the US$18,695,921m the Defense Ministry received.Screenshot of the AFL budget.This researcher then visited the legislative budget office (LBO), a technical arm of the legislature that provides an objective, impartial, and professional analysis of the national budget, to establish if the 2021 Special Budget is also a part of the 2020-2021 FY, and they clarified that “the Special National Budget, Fiscal Year 2021, which ran from July 2021 to December 2021, was a budget year all by itself and cannot be combined with any other budget year.”The AFL’s FY 2020-2021 budget was then subtracted from the FY 2022 budget, and the math resulted in a US$2,881,211m increment, contrary to MICAT’s claim that the army’s budget was increased by $4 million in FY 2022.This researcher reached out to the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Liberia (AFL), Major General Prince Johnson, to have him speak to MICAT’s claim and the content of the budget. Still, Gen Johnson stated, “When we say our budget was increased by $4 million in FY 2022, we meant the Ministry of National Defense, which includes: Central Administration, the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and the Liberia Coast Guard; not specifically the AFL.”Subtracting the Ministry of National Defense FY 2020-2021 from their FY 2022 showed that FY 2022 increased by US$4,283,476m.But what did the increase mean for the ALF?The Chief of Staff explained that “the increment of the army’s FY 2022 budget boosted the operations of the ALF through recruitment of more AFL personnel, promotions of the institution, and renovations of our barracks.”Conclusion The FY 2022 budget reveals that the Ministry of National Defense budget was increased by US$ 4 million and not the AFL. Therefore, MICAT’s claim that “President George Weah increased the army’s budget by US$4 million in FY 2022” is misleading.''The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship in partnership with The Stage Media – Liberia, to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",23/03/2023,https://dubawa.org/misleading-to-suggest-weah-increased-armed-forces-of-liberia-budget-by-us4-million-in-2022-fiscal-year/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liberia’s student politics and the government of the day,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Like any other opposition political party, the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) benefited from the actions of the campus-based Student Unification Party (SUP) while in opposition.But as fate or politics would have it, the SUP has been up against the government of the day over allegations of corruption, bad governance and possible cases of abuse of office.Since its formation, the SUP has considered itself the student group to fight against oppression by political leaders in the country.On Monday, March 13, 2023, what the students believed to be a fight against a lawmaker they accused of being corrupt turned into violence on the campus of the University of Liberia.How did it all start?The chaos was triggered by the singular decision taken by Representative Acarous Moses Gray to have lunch on the campus of the University of Liberia. Moses Gray is also the Representative of Montserrado County, District #8, on which the state-owned University of Liberia is sited.The banner advertising the lunchThe supposed ‘lunch date’ came when students of the University had chased away some past and current officials of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) from the University premises over corruption allegations.In what was expected to be a similar act of revolt against the lawmaker, the students took to Facebook with a statement warning the lawmaker not to step onto the compound of the University.But the lawmaker would not budge. He said that as the District representative in which the University is situated, he had every right to visit the campus and have lunch with friends and constituents without a third party causing trouble.Chaos in the academic cityIt was no vain threat by the students. And with no sign of the lawmaker, Moses Gray holding back on his promise to have lunch on campus, the result was chaos. Clubs, sticks and stones flew in different directions in a bloody confrontation between the students and the lawmaker's supporters. The violence led to multiple injuries on both sides. In the heat of the violence, some students of the University of Liberia, precisely members of the SUP, were chased out of their campus by supporters of a seated Representative.As a result of the clashes, there was huge traffic for several hours, which inconvenienced other motorists.In the end, the advertised lunch could not happen, even though the lawmaker in the company of militants invaded the campus of the university. Both the friends and foes of the lawmaker had injuries to the nurse.This was not the first time the campus-based political party, SUP, had banned an official of the government they claim to be corrupt from accessing the premises of the University. There was no sight of the police to either arrest or maintain law and order.History of violent demonstrationsIn 2015, Alvin Wesseh, a former student, was expelled from the University for a violent demonstration that led to the removal of the then-vice president or provost. Wesseh is currently the Assistant Minister in the CDC-led government.At some point, the current Liberian Vice President, Madam Jewel Howard Taylor, was also at some point booed and chased out of the university; Sanctioned and resigned Liberia’s Solicitor General, Sayma Syrenius Cephus, also suffered a similar fate.However, the most recent was before the infamous lunch incident happened on March 7. The students had booed and chased out Aloysius Howe, the Administrative Aid in the office of Liberia’s Finance and Development Planning Minister Samuel Tweah because he was corrupt.The students’ action against Mr Howe followed a report that the Liberia Institute of Statistic and Geo-Information Service (LISGIS) had paid Mr Howe L$ 160,000. The money was supposed to be used for the sensitisation of census awareness.As a result, the University authorities suspended one student in connection with the incident pending investigation. Public Relations, Atty Norris Toweah, confirmed it to DUWAWA in a WhatsApp chat.Suspension of political activities on campusThe university's authorities have suspended student politics on all of the university’s campuses across the country until otherwise stated.According to a statement issued by the university on March 17, 2023, under the signature of its President, Julius Sarwolo Nelson, the University of Liberia indicated that no political group shall assemble or hold meetings or engage in any politics-related activities on any of the University of Liberia campuses during the suspension period.The UL statement noted, “Students are mandated to keep in strict conformity with this pronouncement. Violators would be severely sanctioned in keeping with the UL Revised Student Handbook. The suspension affects political/solidarity marches, political gatherings, wearing of symbols and emblems depicting and promoting campus-based political groups, student protests, among others.”What are people saying about the chaos?There have been mixed opinions over the conduct of the students vis-a-vis that of Representative Gray. Many people do not agree with the violence and chaos perpetuated by the students despite the chaos. Also, there has been a barrage of condemnations from ordinary Liberians and members of the Liberian Senate, over the March 13, 2023, incident. Some of the critics blamed Representative Gray for the chaos that took place at the state-run University.Senator Numenee Bartekwa of Grand Kru County disclosed that he and the Senate Pro-Tempore made frantic efforts in ensuring that the lawmaker did not show up on the campus, but he ignored them.Senator Abraham Darius Dillon of Montserrado County and opposition lawmaker has also condemned the incident, adding that nobody has got the right to brutalize another citizen.“Booing is a part of democracy and a sign of displeasure by the people as the same way cheering is a sign of approval of the people’s power.”Frank Peter, a caller on a local talk show, said, “to whom much is given, much is expected. Representative Gray has no business on the university campus when the students tell him not to. It does not mean he is weak but just to avoid violence and maintain our peace. Look now what his action has caused the country and his government.”The Liberian National Police (LNP) has since commenced an investigation into the Monday, March 13, 2023, standoff between students of the University of Liberia and supporters of Montserrado County District #8 Representative.",23/03/2023,https://dubawa.org/liberias-student-politics-and-the-government-of-the-day/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessing Weah’s claim to fame as “Feminist-in-Chief” and the cry of women in Liberia,Dubawa,"In October 2018, Liberian leader George Weah declared himself “Liberia’s Feminist-in-Chief.”By that declaration, the Executive Mansion said, the President reaffirms his unwavering commitment to pursuing the feminist ideals that guarantee the rights and wellbeing of women.Five years on as President, it is imperative to thoroughly assess Weah’s record in promoting the interests and security of women, especially when issues of violence and rape against women and girls are said to be on the increase in the country.DUBAWA, in this Explainer, will look beyond the President’s self-proclaimed mantra as “Liberia’s Feminist-in-chief” and ascertain if this proclamation has any true meaning within the context of Liberia women's development.To be feminist-in-chief, one must be committed to equal representation at all levels by reflecting the rights and needs of everyone, particularly women and girls. In a Twitter post in 2021, UN Secretary Antonio Guituress said, “only with women’s equal participation across all spheres will we benefit from the intelligence & experience of all of humanity.”But the story in Liberia is contrary to the expectation of the UN Secretary-General. In Liberia’s midterm Senatorial elections in 2020, President Weah's three-party government put up candidates without picking a single female for that election, thereby leading to widespread criticisms from women's rights activists. In Weah’s cabinet, out of nineteen top ministers, there are only five women represented in total.Violence against Women in LiberiaAs if the discrimination in political appointments is not injurious enough, male violence against women and girls in Liberia has aggressively increased under the watchful eyes of President Weah. For many women and girls in Liberia, the violence they experienced during the 14 years of back-to-back civil crises still occurs.Among other things, rape, early marriage, silence on violence against women and girls, low women representation in the legislature and many others stand as fundamental problems yet to be addressed. Rape is a sexual activity carried out without consent or with a minor. According to Merriam's Dictionary, it includes unlawful sexual activity. Usually, intercourse is carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against a person’s will or with someone beneath a certain age.Liberia is replete with examples of allegations of rape against high-ranking members of government. For instance, in 2020, Mr Weah appointed Foreign Minister D. Maxwell Kemayah amid allegations of sexual harassment from a female staff in Washington DC on Liberia’s permanent UN mission.Though the office of the President acknowledged receipt of a complaint from the sexual harassment survivor against his current Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Liberian “feminist-in-chief” ignored the lady’s concern and commissioned Kemayah as Minister proper without the outcome of any investigation.Like Kemayah, one of the Commissioners at the Independent Human Rights Commission in Liberia, Mohammed Fahnbulleh, was most recently accused of by a female employee in the institution of sexual harassment. An investigation conducted by various civil society actors in Liberia found the accused Commissioner liable for the act. But Fahnbulleh, who denies any wrongdoing, has taken the matter to court as he enjoys the confidence of his boss, President Weah, the self-proclaimed “feminist-in-chief.”OHCHR was established in April 2018, following the signing of a six-year host country agreement with the government of Liberia. The agreement allows the institution to exercise full human rights promotion and protection. According to the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection in Liberia, rape accounted for more than 60% of total Sexual Gender Based Violence cases.The figure on rape from the Gender Ministry was also captured in the 2018 US State Department Report, which was released in 2019. Among other things, the report highlighted that: “Rape is illegal, but the government did not enforce the law effectively, and rape remained a serious and pervasive problem.”In addition, a year before Mr Weah’s elections, the UN report in 2016 indicates: “A very high number of rapes reported in all the 15 counties across the country, with 803 cases in 2015. Rape is the second most commonly reported serious crime in Liberia,” according to the report.The report adds that impunity also prevails for recent rapes, with only two per cent of rapes and Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) cases reported last year resulting in a conviction in court.This report was a pitch not only to the feminist President-elect, Weah, but also one that needed the attention of well-meaning citizens relative to the overriding need to increase accountability for rape in the country. But nothing much has changed during the tenure of President Weah.Early Marriage is the early state of being united as spouses, mostly against the interest of women and girls yet recognised by law. Gender-Based violence refers to harmful acts directed at an individual based on gender.Murder and Weah’s silenceThe evidence of Liberia’s gender-based violence is incontrovertible. However, the most recent test of President Weah’s credential as feminist-in-chief comes from the violent attacks on Liberia’s former Chief Justice, Gloria Musu Scott, the murder of her daughter and injuries to her family. Weeks after the incident, neither the President nor his office issued a public statement condemning the murder. Not even an announcement of an investigation that will lead to a logical conclusion of the case.His silence has been described as worrisome by the Association of Female Lawyers Association. In a statement, they indicated, “We need you, Mr President, to make strong public condemnations of insecurity issues and take action on violence against women and children.”But the women in Liberia have not been as silent as the president. Right from 2020, the women of Liberia staged sporadic protests across the country against all forms of violence, particularly the surge of rape cases in the country. Dressed in dominant black outfits, the women also expressed frustration over Weah’s administration's growing silence on violence against them.“They marched through the streets of Monrovia to petition the Legislature. The protest, named and styled ‘March for Justice,’ caught the government’s attention, pushing them to declare the menace (Rape) a national emergency. Despite declaring rape a national emergency, nothing much has changed.Women and ElectionsAt the seat of government, there is power. This power translates into decisions. Suppose there is any place women must occupy to assert themselves and participate in the decision-making process towards the development of Liberia. In that case, it must be in government through elections or appointments.However, Mr Weah most recently rejected several portions of the new elections law, which among other things, calls for 30% gender representation mainly for women eyeing national leadership through elective political seats in the country. The law also sought to fine and delist political parties that failed to adhere to the 30% gender representation. Sadly, the ""Feminist-in-Chief"" Weah argued that passing the law would violate the ECOWAS Protocol A/SP1/12/01 on Democracy and Good Governance.As mentioned by Mr Weah, this protocol clearly states in article 2 that “no substantial modification shall be made to the electoral laws in the last six months before the elections except with the consent of a majority of political actors.”But, when he (President Weah) ‘Vetoed’ the law, Liberia was just seven months ahead of the October 10, 2023, Presidential and Legislative elections and not six months. Unlike Liberia, the West African nation of Sierra Leone, headed by President Julius Mada Bio in February of this year, passed a gender equality bill reserving 30% seats for women in elected and appointed public offices.Light at the end of the tunnel?Most recently, the Weah-led administration, partners, and traditional leaders agreed to end an old-aged harmful traditional practice in the country. The step to ban female genital mutilation has widely been described as great progress.The US government, through its embassy in Monrovia, most recently lauded the move on the part of the government while urging the Legislature to pass the agreement into law.“I was not here for International Women’s Day, but I still wanted to congratulate the Weah Administration, the traditional leaders, the religious leaders, the women’s support groups, UN Women, and UNDP for going far beyond lip service to taking coordinated action to preserve the Sande while fighting the scourge of FGM,” US Ambassador McCarthy said at a news briefing in MonroviaWhat are Liberians saying?When Liberians first overheard the President’s declaration as feminist-in-chief, they were assured that their rights would be protected and they would have equal space in national decision-making. Still, sadly, many are concerned about the deafening silence from President George Weah.Lisa Tenneh Diasy is a prominent Liberian woman and CEO of Women online TV in Liberia. She said: “The attacks against women must stop. The attacks are huge, happening daily, and this has to stop. Our Country must practice and uphold the tenets of democracy and the respect for human rights.”According to her, WOMEN's rights are human rights, adding, “no matter what professional area a woman occupies, she must not be harassed, intimidated and marginalised. The silence of the current head of state of Liberia towards the current wave of attacks against women says a lot,” Daisy said.The researcher produced this Explainer per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship programme to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",23/03/2023,https://dubawa.org/assessing-weahs-claim-to-fame-as-feminist-in-chief-and-the-cry-of-women-in-liberia/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
False! No evidence to support ritualistic claim against CDC Chairman in Charloe’s murder,Varney Dukuly,"Claim: The family of Justice Gloria Musu-Scott, in a recent statement, quotes the ruling party Chairman Mulbah Morlu as saying, “their daughter Charloe Musu was killed for ritualistic purposes.”Verdict: False. Online research on the particular Press Conference revealed that Morlu did not mention such a statement. The ruling party chairman also openly clarified the allegation to the media.Full TextThe murder and armed robbery attacks on the home of Liberia’s former Chief Justice, Gloria Musu-Scott, have been greeted with several accusations, one of which is coming from the family of Justice Scott.Charloe Musu, daughter of Justice Scott, was murdered on the morning of Thursday, February 23, 2023, at Justice Scott's residence in Brewville on the outskirt of the city.Other members of the household suffered injuries in the attack. It is not yet clear the motive for the murder and the attack but the news of the murder has since gone viral.The police have since begun an investigation into the matter.While citizens look forward to a speedy investigation and the arrest of the culprits, there have been some allegations and counter-allegations. One such is from the family of the former Chief Justice.On March 6, 2023, the family issued a statement accusing the ruling party chairman, Mulbah Morlu, of making statements against the family.The statement partly reads, “On Thursday, March 2, 2023, the chairman of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change - CDC, Mulbah Morlu, had a Press Conference at the CDC headquarters in Sinkor. It was held immediately after the Liberian Women Sit-in Action in protest at the Legislature on Capitol Hill seat against the murder and assault against the Musu family.”The family statement accused Mr Morlu of saying Charloe was killed for “ritualistic purposes.”The murder of Charloe has triggered widespread, vehement public condemnation in the country.The institutions and groups that have expressed disdain over the attacks include the Liberia National Bar Association, former Vice President and Standard bearer of the former ruling Unity Party, Joseph Nyuma Boakai.The gravity of the situation involving former Chief Justice Gloria Musu Scott and her daughter's death and the accusation against the party chairman form the basis for this fact-check.VerificationGiven the sensitive nature of the claim, DUBAWA decided to contact the family for evidence of its claim against the party chairman. But the family of the former Chief Justice, when contacted for a response, declined to verify the claim as indicated in their Press statement.The Family spokesperson Julius Musu in a telephone conversation with this researcher, said the family would not respond to the inquiry seeking answers over an allegation raised in their most recent release.“All I can tell you is that the matter is before the police, and the family is cooperating, and that is all for now,” Julius Musu said on the phone.The researcher scrutinised the video of March 2, 2023, press conference, which formed the basis of the ritual murder accusation attributed to Mr Morlu. From the scrutiny, it is clear there was no such accusation in the video.Though the family statement alleged that Chairman Morlu of President Weah's ruling Coalition said their daughter was used for ritual, he debunked the claim via telephone interview with OK FM on March 6, 2023.His rebuttal, which can be heard between the 2:04:05sec on the show, among other things, rejected the claim, “that is not true, I never said that. Several credible media institutions covered my press conference. The videos are out there.”ConclusionThe claim by the former chief justice, Gloria Musu Scott's family, which accuses Mr Weah's three-party government chairman Mulbah Morlu of saying that Charloe Musu, daughter of Justice Scott, was killed for ritual purposes, is false.The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with OK FM to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",22/03/2023,https://dubawa.org/false-no-evidence-to-support-ritualistic-claim-against-cdc-chairman-in-charloes-murder/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liberia and Biometric Voters Registration ahead of October’s Elections,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Ahead of Liberia’s Presidential and Legislative elections, dated October this year, the country has decided to conduct a biometric voters’ registration process through the National Elections Commission (NEC).Biometric registration produces a credible voter registration roll and, by extension, credible elections, as has been witnessed across the globe. Through this explainer, DUBAWA will explore the biometric registration process in Liberia and how it works.What is Biometrics?Biometrics is body measurements and calculations related to human characteristics. Biometric authentication is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control.According to INNOVATRICS ABIS, Biometric Voter Registration System is a complete solution combining customisable registration software, accurate biometric de-duplication and automated detection of children or minors based on AI-powered age estimation.Biometric Voter Registration also involves using computers, fingerprint scanners and digital cameras to capture the bio-data of individuals within a system. It uses unique features of a voter's physical characteristics, including facial features or fingerprints and demographic data, to identify a person.According to the Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), “All biometric data is first captured by a camera or sensor as an image. The image is then processed into a biometric template and stored in a database paired with given information, such as the person’s name and birthdate. These images make up their voter profile. Through the widespread collection, a biometric voter register is created.”How Biometric Voters Registration WorksAccording to the IDEA, the technology targets identity theft, multiple voting and other voter fraud and manipulation mechanisms. It also presents an opportunity to provide better electoral rolls and the integrity of elections.Story before BiometricPrior to the introduction of the Biometric Voters’ Registration process, the National Elections Commission in the past has been using Optical Manual Registration for the registration process during the elections period.In 2020, the Collaborating Political Parties (CPP) demanded the clean-up of the voter's Registration Roll (VRR) used during the 2017 and 2020 presidential and legislative elections.This call by the CPP led to a team of IT experts from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) coming to Liberia to assist the NEC in cleaning up the national voter roll.Also, during the use of the old system, there were allegations of multiple registrations by applicants and the process of voters being used across the country. For instance, one person used to register more than once but at different locations across the country without being detected by the system, thus leading to fraud during the election process.According to the head of the National Elections Commission (NEC), Madam Davidetta Browne Lansanah, the system's transition would greatly help the election process in Liberia.Madam Browne Lansanah voiced, “the disadvantages of the old OMR system include duplicate records from the Voters Registration System; and the issues related to unintentional errors during the data entry process.”Why is Biometric important?The credibility of a voter registration roll gives rise to credible, free, fair and transparent elections in any country, and Liberia is no exception.Over the years, the Biometric system has become the safest way of producing a credible voter registration roll for any country's election process.As a result, the Liberian government, through the National Elections Commission (NEC) in 2022, announced using a biometric voters’ registration process to safeguard the Voters’ Registration Roll (VRR) to deliver credible elections.On February 24, 2023, the NEC officially launched the Biometric Voters’ Registration exercise process. The process is expected to kick-start on March 20, 2023, and has since announced vacancies for qualified Liberians to conduct the exercise.According to the NEC boss, using Liberia's Biometric Voter Registration System will greatly help the country’s electoral processes. Thus, it will help prevent multiple applicant registrations and proper identification of voting precincts.Addressing a news conference, Madam Browne Lansanah announced using a biometric voter-identification system, which she said would prevent electoral fraud and chaos during the elections period, a situation that has always marred previous elections.Madam Lansanah put the cost of the biometric project at about US$ 12 million but may face some hitches, according to a Front Page Africa (FPA) report.Contrary to the newspaper’s report, the company in charge of the project, Laxton, has rejected the report, saying that Liberia’s Biometric Voters’ Registration System is on course.History of the Biometric ContractThe award of the Biometric contract to Laxton Group was mired by huge controversy and an in-house fight between the National Elections Commission (NEC) and the Public Procurement and Concession Commission (PPCC).It was reported that the PPCC granted a “no objection” to the NEC, which led to the NEC awarding the contract to Lexton Group after a bidding process.The NEC carried out the first bidding exercise. Still, the PPCC rejected it because the two companies that won first and second place did not meet the standard to be awarded the contract, thus ordering another round of bidding process that saw Laxton Group becoming the contractor.What do Liberians think about the BVR Process?DUBAWA engaged the views of Liberians about the Biometric Voters’ Registration exercise and what they believe would be the impact of the system.Representative Rustonlyn Suacoco Dennis of Montserrado County District #4 said that in as much as biometric registration is good, she believes that the country's electoral system is not yet prepared to absorb it.Representative Dennise stated, “a biometric system has never been tested at the community level or during the country's recent by-elections. As such, it may not be prudent to use it to determine the outcome of the Presidential & Representative elections.”Martin Nyankun is a Liberian who this researcher engaged while boarding a taxi on Broad Street in Central Monrovia. Nyankun told DUBAWA that the BVR process is good because it will help protect the integrity of the country’s electoral process.Nyankun stated, “though it will be our first time, we can do it. Other countries have done it; therefore, we, too, can do it. The beginning of everything is challenging, but with the level of work we as a country and people are willing to put in, we can achieve this together.”The Elections Coordinating Committee (ECC), a leading civil society network responsible for promoting electoral integrity in Liberia, has also welcomed the move by the NEC to transition to the BVR system.According to an ECC statement, the technology, if properly set up, would add value to the quality of the electoral process, thereby reducing double registration, automatic deduplication fraud, and manipulation of the voter roll.",12/03/2023,https://dubawa.org/liberia-and-biometric-voters-registration-ahead-of-octobers-elections/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"False! AME University, AME Zion University Presidents still at post",Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: A newspaper and a pressure group say AMEU President Alvin Attah and AMEZU President Benjamin Lartey have both stepped down.Verdict: The Presidents of the two universities have not resigned. The claim by the Analyst Newspaper and Martin Kollie, the lead campaigner of the Campaigners for Academy Crimes Court (CACC), made is false.Full TextOn Tuesday, February 14, 2023, the Liberian Government, through the National Commission on Higher Education, issued a statement mandating all Presidents and Vice Presidents for Academic Affairs of Universities in the country to have doctorate degrees.The statement, which went viral on Facebook, states that honorary degree holders are disallowed from serving as a President or Vice President for Academic Affairs at any higher education institutions (universities) in Liberia.As a result of this statement, the lead campaigner of the Campaigners for Academy Crimes Court (CACC) in Liberia, Martin Kollie, posted on Facebook that the Presidents of the African Methodist Episcopal University (AMEU) and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion University (AMEZU) Alvin Attah and Benjamin Lartey respectively had resigned their posts.This post made by Martin Kollie had over 240 comments, 54 shares and over 335 emojis.DUBAWA also contacted Martin Kollie to discover the source of his information, but he said he could not disclose his source because “they are insiders at the two universities.”Martin suggested to DUBAWA that “the presidents resigned but only chose to be hypocritical to save face when Minister Ansu Sonii ‘suspended’ the NCHE policy four days after.”Also, a local daily, The Analyst newspaper, reported in its Friday, February 17, 2023, edition that the Presidents of the two universities have resigned.VerificationDUBAWA visited the official websites of AME University and AME Zion University to ascertain whether official statements had been issued by the universities regarding the matter but could find nothing to that effect.Instead, the two universities stated on Tuesday, February 21, 2023, denying the report by the Analyst newspaper and the lead campaigner of the Campaigners for Academy Crimes Court (CACC) in Liberia, Martin Kollie.“The Board of Trustees of the AME University, the policy-making body of the university, would have had to meet any acceptance of the alleged and speculative resignation letter of the President of the University, as well to decide on any further course of action needed to be taken for the protection and continued smooth operations of the university,” a statement signed by the AME University Board of Trustees reads.The statement furthered, “the publication was made in the absence of any evidence of a meeting having been held by the Board of Trustee of the AMEU to discuss any of the issues stated in the analyst’s speculative and false news story.”A statement signed by the AME Zion University Vice President administration also reads, “the Board of Trustees and administration of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion University (AMEZU) all partners, students, employees and the general public, that information being circulated about the resignation of Dr Benjamin Lartey, President of the University is false and diabolical and intended to undermine the University.”DUBAWA also engaged authorities of the National Commission on Higher Education (NCHE) as to what prompted their recent decision and why it was necessary.According to the NCHE Head, Professor Edward Lama Wonkeryor, the decision resulted from a promise made months ago to eliminate the rising number of tertiary institution presidents without terminal degrees. He clarified that it was a way to stop the country's higher education system from deteriorating.“To achieve the much-needed reform of our higher education system as advocated by President George Manneh Weah, the NCHE is implementing all policies and standards established for the governance of the sector, especially those policies that seek to place our higher education system into equivalence with our regional and international contemporaries,” the Professor said.However, DUBAWA discovered that the Ministry of Education is not in favour of said policy issued by the NCHE. Consequently, the Ministry, through its Minister, told the state-owned media entity, The Liberia Broadcasting System or ELBC, that the policy has been suspended and will remain so until the Board of Commissioners of the NCHE meets.“The policy will remain suspended until the NCHE Director General, Dr Edward Wonkeryor, and the Board of Commissioners meet for appropriate consultation and justification. While the Board of Commissioners is committed to reforming the higher education sector, and policy implementation must be done appropriately,” Minister Ansu Sonii said.The National Commission on Higher Education (NCHE) was founded in 1989 by an Act of the National Legislature to formulate broad policy guidelines for establishing Institutions of Higher Education in Liberia. It serves as the regulatory body for all institutions offering degrees and as the principal liaison between institutions of learning offering degrees in the country.ConclusionBased on extensive research made by DUBAWA concerning claims made by both the Analyst newspaper and the lead campaigner of the Campaigners for Academy Crimes Court (CACC) lead campaigner, the two university presidents are still effective in their respective posts.",07/03/2023,https://dubawa.org/false-ame-university-ame-zion-university-presidents-still-at-post/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liberia’s dual citizenship debacle: The voice of the people or the wants of elites?,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Liberia held a referendum to vote on some proposed changes to the country’s constitution on December 8, 2020. Among the proposals was the issue of dual citizenship, change in the date of elections, and reduction in tenure of the President, Speaker, and Pro-Tempore of the House of Representatives and the Liberian Senate.The referendum resulted from a nationwide constitutional review process carried out by the Constitutional Review Committee (CRC) of Liberia and headed by former Chief Justice of the Liberian Supreme Court, Cllr. Gloria Musa Scott.The committee was established with the sole intent of reviewing the country’s 1986 constitution and making the necessary amendments where needed. However, according to the result of the referendum released by the National Elections Commission of Liberia (NEC), no proposition met the constitutional requirement of obtaining the requisite votes to be passed. Thus, all eight propositions, including the call for the acceptance of dual citizenship, were rejected during the referendum process.Despite the overwhelming rejection of the referendum and, by implication, the dual citizenship, Liberians have witnessed the execution of the dual citizenship law, which has angered some citizens.So how did a proposal rejected by the people of Liberia in a referendum find its way back into the law books of Liberia? DUBAWA explores how it happened, whether or not it was legal and what the lawmakers and other interest groups are saying about it.The Amendment after ReferendumThe constitution of Liberia in chapter 12, Article 91 of 1986, featuring amendments, stipulates how any article within the Liberian body can be amended.“This Constitution may be amended whenever a proposal by either (1) two-thirds of the membership of both Houses of the Legislature or (2) a petition submitted to the Legislature, by not fewer than 10,000 citizens which receives the concurrence of two-thirds of the membership of both Houses of the Legislature, is ratified by two-thirds of the registered voters, voting in a referendum conducted by the Elections Commission not sooner than one year after the action of the Legislature,” it states.On July 19, 2022, both houses of the Legislature, the House of Representatives and the Liberian Senate agreed to amend Chapter 20 of the Aliens Nationality Law of Liberia, as seen in this news report.Before this amendment, the law stated that unless they have previously resided in Liberia, a child who is a citizen by virtue of the provisions should lose their citizenship. They must go before a Liberian consul and take the oath of allegiance to the Republic of Liberia, which is required of a petitioner for naturalisation, before attaining the age of 23 to be considered citizens.Limitation of the Dual Citizenship LawArticle 4 of the Amendment Law states that Liberians with dual citizenship will be ineligible to hold any elected public office and ministerial positions like Defense Minister, Governor of the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) and Minister of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP). It further states that any such person interested in contesting for an elected public office must renounce the citizenship of the other country at least one year before applying to the National Election Commission to be a candidate.So while the lawmakers may have followed due process in bringing back a Dual Citizens law that the citizens have overwhelmingly rejected through a referendum, the citizens appear not to be on the same wavelength.What motivated the lawmakers to pass this law?DUBAWA spoke to the lawmakers from the ruling establishment and the opposition on what motivated them to pass a law the citizens had rejected.Montserrado County Senator and member of the opposition Liberty party, Abraham Darius Dillon, said that Dual Citizenship is in the country's best interest and that every Liberian should support it.“When a Liberian citizen goes out of the country and acquires citizenship, they always come back to Liberia to invest by building homes in the country,” he stated.He added that the law prior to the amendments was inconsistent with Liberia’s Supreme Law. Citing Article 2 of the 1986 Liberian Constitution, Dillon affirms that the government was right to amend the law.The Liberian Constitution, in Article 2 of 1986, states, “Any laws, treaties, statutes, decrees, customs and regulations found to be inconsistent with it shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void and of no legal effect. The Supreme Court, under its power of judicial review, is empowered to declare any inconsistent laws unconstitutional.”What do Liberians think about the law?A Liberian journalist, and host of a popular radio talk show in the country, Weekie Brooks, is unsatisfied with the lawmakers' conduct.Brooks, who is the host of the program “The Morning Ride” aired on Kool 91.9 FM and its official Facebook page on Monday, January 9, 2023, indicated that the legislature and executive branches of the Liberian government virtually overturned the results of the country’s 2020 National Referendum all by themselves without consulting the people who put them in Parliament.“There are decisions made by Librarians but most often overturned by the Executive and Legislative branches of government. People you sent to represent you should sometimes come back to consult you on some of their decisions. They do not care about you,” Mr Brooks stated.Following his outburst, DUBAWA decided to engage the views of a cross-section of Liberians on what they make of their lawmakers’ decision to bring back a law they, the citizens, had rejected.The researcher visited the University of Liberia (UL) to engage lecturers and students on the bill.Mr Kpanyoun Philip Wakocco, a demography lecturer, told DUBAWA he is in favour of the amended law by the legislature because it provides potential Liberians, who would otherwise have been denied, an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the growth and development of the country.“I’m in favour of this Bill because this is a very good Bill. It is good because it will allow other Liberians outside of the country to contribute to nation-building and the country’s economy, Even though I am in favour of this Bill, I do not fully agree with the part that limits those dual citizens Liberians from holding certain governmental positions,” he said.Felo Dennis, a student, told DUBAWA that the law is not in the best interest of the ordinary Liberian people. Dennis indicated that lawmakers make these kinds of laws to only benefit them and their children born outside the country.“We pay them a huge sum, and they live in luxury. When their wives are pregnant, they take them outside the country to give birth. In return, those children become citizens of that country. They get a better education and live the best of life at our expense, and they, in return, come back to rule us because of the law they have passed,” Dennis said.DUBAWA also engaged the views of some petty traders. Ma Musu, who sells bitter balls and pepper, said that the law is only in the interest of the rich.“These people are only doing this for themselves and their families and friends,” she said.Richard Massaley, another trader down Waterside market in central Monrovia and one of Liberia’s leading commercial hubs, told DUBAWA that the law is good and in the country's and its people's best interest. Massaley believes that the law will aid the country’s growth.“These very people are already contributing to the country’s economy through the remittances they send back home to family members. Why don’t we make them our citizens when they are Liberians?” he said.",01/03/2023,https://dubawa.org/liberias-dual-citizenship-debacle-the-voice-of-the-people-or-the-wants-of-elites/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Joseph Nyumah Boakai deciding to support Alexander Cummings after retirement, False!",Varney Dukuly,"Claim: ‘Former Vice President has decided to support Cummings following retirement from politics,’ Sekou Kalasco Damaro, Presidential Aide to Weah, alleges.Verdict: False. Joseph Nyumah Boakai (JNB) refuted the claims about his resignation on his official Facebook page. He further states that the Vice President will contest the Presidency come October.Full TextA screenshot of an alleged Facebook account, which carries the photograph and full name of Joseph Nyumah Boakai (JNB), was widely shared, saying: “I have served the people for over 43 years and understand that it is time to move on in different directions. Today I have decided to withdraw my bid for the presidency. I believe the way forward is to give a chance to somebody who understands how to fix this country. I’ve decided to support Alex Cumming.“I’ve served the people for over 43 years and understand that it is now time to move in a different direction. Today, I've decided to withdraw my bid for the presidency. I believe the way forward is to give a chance to somebody who understands how to fix this country. I’ve decided to support Cummings.”One of the Facebook users who shared the news was an aide to the incumbent president, Sekou Kalasco Damaro. Damaro captioned the post: “Finally, former Vice President Boakai has decided to support Cummings. The game is on.”The post generated mixed reactions in public, culminating in over five hundred comments and two hundred emoji on Facebook.Like Sekou, another Facebook user Samson Mosery believed to be a supporter of Mr Alexander Cummings, wrote that the news of Mr Boakai stepping down was confirmed.In addition, Estrada Duke Jayajy posted a picture of Ghana’s sitting president Akufo-Addo congratulating JNB on Twitter about his supposed resignation from politics.VerificationAmid the rounds of his resignation from politics and subsequent support for Mr Cummings of the opposition Alternative National Congress (ANC), Joseph Boakai, in response, debunked the claim while describing the screenshot as ‘fake.’""I’ve seen a screenshot of a post circulating on social media from a fake Joseph Nyuma Boakai page that I am not contesting for the presidency in October 2023. Let me reassure the Liberians that nothing will stop the Rescue Mission we are embarking upon. We will be on the ballot, and with God above, we will succeed in rescuing this our beloved country,” he said.DUBAWA also visited the official Twitter page of Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo, hoping to find the post in which the president congratulated JNB but saw nothing of that sort. After carefully examining the page containing the controversial tweet, DUBAWA observed that the blue tick had been used as a verified account for the president. However, checks on the official Twitter account of Ghana’s president show a grey tick instead.According to Twitter, the blue verified ticks are for persons or individuals, whilst the grey verified ticks are for governments.ConclusionBased on our findings, the claim that Boakai has resigned from Liberian politics and has decided to support Alexander B. Cummings is false.The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with OK FM to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",01/03/2023,https://dubawa.org/joseph-nyumah-boakai-deciding-to-support-alexander-cummings-after-retirement-false/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Regulatory failure, a function that undermines public sector development: “Liberia in focus”",Varney Dukuly,"Regulatory failure is defined in different ways by different people. According to the London School of Economics, “there is no agreement on a single, clear-cut and universally applicable definition of what might constitute a ‘regulatory failure.’In his paper on regulatory governance, Prof Jeroen van der Heijden, Chair in Regulatory Practice of Victoria University of Wellington, defines the concept as a “lack of success in realising the desirable societal outcomes that a piece of regulation was developed to achieve.” But even this definition, he admits, is inconclusive.For this report, this researcher will look at Liberia’s regulatory failure within the context of this definition and to assess the legal and desirable societal outcomes of some of the key regulatory agencies in Liberia, particularly the National Port Authority, the Liberia Drug Enforcement Agency and whether or not those outcomes were achieved.First and foremost, it is important to establish the legal framework under which these public institutions in Liberia were built and why.For instance, the National Port Authority (NPA) was established by an Act of the National Legislature in 1967 and amended in 1970 as a state-owned corporation to manage, plan and build all public ports in Liberia.In partnership with the public and private sectors, the NPA has a strategic vision to strengthen the economy, improve international trade, and spur tourism and community development by making its ports of entry and surrounding areas the most efficient and effective for generations to come. However, it cannot be said that the port authorities have efficiently and effectively managed the port.Again, the Liberia Drug Enforcement Agency (LDEA) is a semi-autonomous agency under the supervisory authority of the Ministry of Justice, responsible for the effective and efficient enforcement of laws about controlled drugs, substances and precursors, including essential chemicals.The Act, among other things, permits the Liberia Drugs Enforcement Agency to play a drug-crime-focused role in national enforcement by implementing measures to protect the territorial borders of Liberia from the importation and exportation of drugs and controlled substances.In Liberia, there is a drug law that the 54th National Legislature recently passed, and it frowns on the importation, sale and usage of narcotic substances in the country.The drug law, before the President for signature, indicated that those found culpable in the sale and importation of narcotic substances would be jailed without bail. End users, on the other hand, the law says, will have access to bail, but there will be other punitive measures to deter others.Despite the legal framework and societal expectations of these agencies, the nation and its people continue to experience some amount of regulatory breaches from time to time.One of the common examples of regulatory failures in Liberia is the unregulated movement of motorbikes and tri-cycle riders (Keh keh) in Monrovia and other parts of the country.The Ministry of Transport is the state-owned institution charged by an Act of Legislation to formulate and administer transport activities in Liberia.These riders’ mainly young people, are seen moving passengers daily and plying almost all the major roads and street corners in the city and beyond amid an instituted no-go zone regulation for certain areas declared by state authority.Their movement bears a record of revenue for their livelihood. However, due to dangerous driving, many have fallen prey to accidents, some of which have led to the deaths and injuries of tens of thousands of riders in Liberia.Hard-core criminals are also giving a negative reputation to some of the good motorbike and tricycle riders. Apart from violating traffic regulations, Liberians are beginning to associate property theft and the snatching of bags, cellphones and other valuable items from ordinary people to some bike riders in Monrovia.Image Source: Daily Observer Newspaper.Flouting city ordinance laws by unscrupulous individuals concerning garbage disposal in Monrovia is another regulatory failure that continues to send a bad omen to visitors and foreign residents about the cleanliness of Liberia’s capital, Monrovia.In the filth is the Monrovia City Corporation (MCC) which ought to be providing oversight responsibility regarding regulations aimed at keeping the city clean and green. The MCC is also responsible for Waste Management in the city.Image: Waste site in Monrovia.But, as we view regulatory failures, it is also critical to draw attention to one particular subject that is affecting the future jurors (young people) of Liberia, and that is ‘narcotic substances.’The proliferation of narcotic substances among young people in Liberia is alarming. It becomes even more troubling waking up to the news of the importation of huge quantities of drugs leaving the nation’s biggest port of entry, the Freeport.Sometime in October 2022, the news media was awash with reports of a huge quantity of drugs that slipped through the Freeport of Monrovia.Media reports noted that the container believed to be ‘frozen food’ cargo had cocaine worth over US$100 million.According to Front Page Africa Newspaper, the suspected ringleader, a Brazilian named Gustavo Henrique, was recently arrested along with two others in Sierra Leone while trying to flee Liberia.The Liberia Drug Enforcement Agency has since burned the US$100 million drug, but an investigation is said to be ongoing. This slippage in regulation followed the failure of regulators to honour a given instruction.Part one of the statutory law creating the Liberia Drug Enforcement Agency (LDEA) states, among other things, that the LDEA shall formulate, monitor and coordinate national programs for combating illicit drug product trafficking and drug money laundering.22.104b-c of Part one (1) of the law also authorises the Liberia Drug Enforcement Agency to investigate the alleged offences, arrest and apprehend as well as search all alleged violators and seize for confiscation, the effects or proceeds as provided by law and take custody thereof.The law and the societal expectation of the LDEA, notwithstanding, drugs with a market value of $100m, still slipped through its ports.The container, which had the drugs, interestingly had a Global Tracking Maritime Services (GTMS) stamp urging the Liberian authority to conduct a physical examination on the container before its exit from the port. This, however, was never done.Inspection Certificate Order (GTMS).Drug bust (cocaine).The drug bust comes at a time when youth are walloping in drugs and other unscrupulous activities, with ghettoes springing up in every community across the country.A group of At-Risk Youth in Liberia, Source: ?UNFPA Liberia.A senior economist and public sector analyst for over 13 years in Liberia, Sam Smith provides insight into regulatory failures in the public and private sectors.Smith said the government provides the enabling environment so that the private sector can take the lead; according to him, this gives the government the responsibility of a regulator.According to him, in most countries, most meaningful growth is undertaken by the private sector, not the public sector.“In those countries, companies are driven by profit, so you have two or three companies producing the same commodity. If you don’t have a neutral institution regulating their activities, they might harm the public interest or public goods. So the presence of government in that setting ensures that competition is healthy, the consumer gets value for money, and the producer is protected. That is the essence of having regulation; people’s behaviour should be regulated.”Mr Smith, a Harvard-trained Public Administrator, stressed that people are self-interested, adding, “they behave in a manner that gives them joy; if they are firm, they behave in a manner that gives them the greatest profit. In some instances, their objective may come contrary to the objective of the public.”Why are there regulatory failures?“One thing I can put my finger on for which we have regulatory failure is the lack of political will in enforcing the law and self-interest. Regulators themselves have their interests. The people constitute governments; people come from different backgrounds. In a democracy, contributions are made to politicians for whom politicians have a constituency they must protect,” said Sam Smith.He said this creates what he called the ‘Agent Principal’ problem.“Am I protecting the interest of the higher contributors to my campaign, or am I protecting the interest of those who voted for me?” he asked.“Having different or multiple interests, protecting the interest of your voting constituency or protecting the interest of your campaign contributors; that could be some of the reasons we have Regulatory Failures.”He mentioned that regulatory failure combines several factors, such as failure to implement the law in the book and failure to draw the line between private interest and public interest.On the question of how we end up with these failures, he said people have not been answerable for all their actions taken in the past.The way out of all these challenges, the Harvard train indicated that the government must make accountability the hallmark and, at the same time, make communication a key priority so that citizens get informed about what is happening and how it benefits them.Dr Artemus Gaye, a Co-executive officer of the Prince Ibrahima & Isabella Freedom Foundation based in the USA and West Africa, in an interview with DUBAWA, provided a perspective on the different types of ‘Regulatory Failure’ and its impact on society.Dr Gaye defines ‘Analytical failure’ as knowing and understanding the analysis of a particular situation and its flaws. Intervention failure, he said, is about knowing why the regulatory activity was inadequate or flawed in mitigating or remedying problems or the identified problem(s).“Coordination failure, the ineffectiveness of the various bodies to coordinate in addressing the problems; political failure (the failed system due to poor political planning that creates lingering tensions and unresolved political issues) and, Design failure (this occurs when the laws and regulatory bodies and statutes including resources are inadequate to address these issues,” said Dr Gaye.When asked about his view on the entire subject?He said: “This is a subject matter that must form the basis of well-planned public policies and nation-building process as in the case of Liberia.”Dr Gaye, a writer of several historical kinds of literature, including ‘The Tossed American Pie,’ averred that while there are various views on it, he can safely argue that there is no single emerging definition for regulatory failure.But he noted that “when the wrong people and the lack of socio-political will of a nation become the engines to drive the necessary common good of a people or a nation,” adding this is the reason we have a facade democracy in Liberia and a country ranked at the bottom of global development.”According to him, it is more of a societal problem because of the failure of those in charge of the resources and power structure to abide by and implement these laws.Dr Gaye believes that corruption in its many forms – administrative, financial, and poor skill sets leads to these systemic failures. “Can a plane be piloted by a plumber? Misplacement and the lack of political will lead to this demise.”He mentioned that Liberia and other African States “have not been attentive to history and selective in our narrative. Until we can re-examine ourselves as a nation and reset our national agenda based on the merit system and the enforcement of good laws, we will always fail the regulatory test,” Dr Gaye accentuated.What are the ramifications?He said: “We become a poor nation, failing at all the indices and with Stockholm syndrome being the order of the day.”Pursuing the way forward for Liberia, Dr Gaye stated that a national conference and educational awareness of the importance of these rules are necessary to safeguard the common good.He added that it was important that those in charge as regulators should succeed in managing public expectations as they manage risks.“Public trust is key to this process as it can help to shape public confidence. Once these steps are taken, the general public will see those in charge responding to their needs rather than pointing fingers and playing the blame game.”“The researcher produced this Media Literacy per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame Karikari Fellowship partnership with Independent NewsPaper/OK FM to facilitate the ethics of “Truth” in Journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.”",17/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/regulatory-failure-a-function-that-undermines-public-sector-development-liberia-in-focus/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Violating electoral laws with impunity: The case of politicians and pre-campaign in Liberia,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"The election is a key pillar in every democratic dispensation, and the story in Liberia is no different.The Article 83 (A) of the Liberian constitution states, “Voting for the President, Vice-President, members of the Senate and members of the House of Representatives shall be conducted throughout the Republic on the second Tuesday in October of each election year.”Also, Article 50 of the same constitution states, among other things, that “the president shall be elected by universal adult suffrage of registered voters in the Republic and shall hold office for a term of six years commencing at noon on the third working Monday in January of the year immediately following the elections.”Upon these constitutional dictates, the country is now gearing up to conduct its presidential and legislative elections come October of this year.As part of the processes leading to these elections, the National Elections Commission (NEC), the statutory body responsible for the conduct of elections in the country, has released a series of guidelines for the conduct of the process.According to the NEC’s guidelines issued recently in the country, campaign processes begin on August 5 and end on October 8, 2023. The guidelines also include the official publication of accreditation of Party Agents, Media, and Observers for Voter Registration which will run from January 23, 2023, to February 20, 2023.The timetable also indicated that from February 6 to 20, 2023, there will be the publication of Voter Registration Centers. Then February 20, 2023, will be the date for the official launch of the Civic and Voter Education for Voter Registration process. In essence, the Voter Registration process runs from March 20, 2023, to May 11, 2023, among other activities.But it appears that this guideline, particularly pre-campaigning, has been ignored and brushed aside by political parties.As a result, DUBAWA embarked on a journey to ascertain the extent to which some political parties are breaching the election guidelines by organising political rallies and posting political parties’ flyers, stickers, billboards or t-shirts. We also explore the consequences of the breach.What is pre-campaigning during elections?According to the National Elections Commission (NEC)’s guidelines, section 2.5 (b) found on page 15 of this document, pre-campaign activities include “forming of a political movement, association, or others to solicit votes and/or promote an individual aspirant or candidate by way of speech, picture, banner, posters or any other printed materials that tend to promote an individual aspirant or candidate for an elective public office.”It further stated, “holding a march, parade, or other assemblies to solicit votes and/or promote an individual aspirant or candidate by way of speech, picture, banner, posters, placards or any other printed materials that tend to promote an individual aspirant or candidate for an elective public office.”According to clause (D) of this same section of the guidelines, “an aspirant or candidate found to have violated any of the herein provisions against premature activities shall be ineligible to contest the election to which the violation relates.”So which parties are violating the guideline?DUBAWA observed that throughout the streets of Monrovia, there are billboards, stickers and even t-shirts bearing the photograph of incumbent President George Weah with inscriptions like, “I support Weah 2023,” “In Him, We Are Well Pleased,” and “Friends of Kalasco Support Weah 2023,” among others as in these pictures.DUBAWA cannot independently confirm if these posters and billboards were published or mounted by the candidates themselves or were sanctioned by them, except to say the sight of these before the opening of the campaign period is a violation of the election law.Even more grievous is the poster of Sekou Kalasco Damaro, the Special Aid to President George Manneh Weah. Mr Damaro was appointed by President Weah in 2018 and has since held the position.According to Part-V, section 5.1(A, B and C) of the Code of Conduct, “all Officials appointed by the President of the Republic of Liberia shall not:a) Engage in political activities, canvass or contest for elected offices;b) Use Government facilities, equipment or resources in support of partisan or political activities;c) Serve on a campaign team of any political party or the campaign of any independent candidate.”The clarity of the law notwithstanding, Mr Damaro has been using his official Facebook page to propagate campaign messages for President Weah’s 2023 bid ahead of the official campaign period, as seen here and here.As a result of this action by Mr Damaro, a senior executive of the main opposition and former secretary of the immediate past ruling Unity Party (UP) led regime, Mohammed Ali, popularly known as Mo Ali too, took to his Facebook page with a threat: “The CDC has declared official campaign opened. They are posting billboards and flyers all over the place. We will follow suit, and that compromised NEC will not do fwen (nothing). Dear Liberian people, VOTE for JOSEPH NYUMA BOAKAI for president in the October 10, 2023, Presidential election,” he wrote.These pre-campaign violations have become the centre of discussions in the country. A Liberian journalist, William Lloyd, took to his Facebook page and had this to say “UPHOLDING THE RULES, STRENGTHENING OUR DEMOCRACY: LET's ENSURE A FAIR AND LAWFUL 2023 ELECTIONS.Sekou Kalasco Damaro, the violation of National Elections Commission rules regarding campaign activities by the CDC is detrimental to President Weah's re-election efforts. According to the NEC revised timeline, campaign activities are only allowed from August 5 to October 8. Wearing campaign materials and holding political gatherings outside the designated campaign period blatantly disregards the 2023 elections schedule and violates election law.”DUBAWA reached out to Mr Damaro via his Facebook page for a response but is yet to respond.The nomination rallyInterestingly, DUBAWA has been informed of the successful holding of the nomination process of President Weah by the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC). The nomination, expected to be held in December last year, was eventually held on Saturday, February 4, 2023, at the Antoinette Tubman Stadium (ATS) in central Monrovia.After the nomination, a mini rally was held with hundreds if not thousands of supporters and partisans of the ruling CDC taking to the streets of Monrovia and within some counties like Lofa, Bomi, and Nimba to pledge their support to President Weah for another six years term.Persons believed to be supporters of the ruling CDC were also seen in their party’s regalia bearing the image of President George Weah and the Party’s logo and a red and blue beret bearing the party’s emblem.As a result of this nomination rally, some businesses within central Monrovia and its environs were closed, with huge traffic seen all over the streets. Some ordinary citizens told DUBAWA they were left frustrated after long hours in the traffic while going about their everyday activities.During the official program, President Weah accepted to contest for the second term of the Liberian Presidency after being asked through a petition by his supporters and partisans.   President Weah voiced, “fellow partisans and supporters, I have accepted your request for me to contest for the second term and to be your leader for the next six years. If the Liberian people grant me a second term, they should be prepared to grace another leader when that term ends. Our constitution does not permit a third term, so I will gladly stand down in 2030.”As a result of this alleged violation and many others by political parties and independent candidates in the country, the Elections Coordinating Committee (ECC), a leading civil society network responsible for promoting electoral integrity in Liberia, issued a statement.According to ECC’s statement, the action of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) was a complete violation. Thus, the violation undercut the principle of what the ECC termed a level playing field required for the conduct of free, fair and transparent elections in the country.ECC said in her statement, “The Elections Coordinating Committee (ECC) observed that the political rally organised by the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) on February 4, 2023, is a campaign activity. It is a flagrant violation of Section 12 of the National Elections Commission’s (NEC) Regulation on the conduct of political parties and coalitions. The rally was characterised by wearing T-Shirts and printing banners depicting the picture of the President when the official campaign period outlined in the election timeline had not started. This violation undercuts the principle of a “level playing field” required for the conduct of a fair and credible election.”Meanwhile, the National Election Commission (NEC) on Wednesday, February 8, 2023, warned against political parties of independent candidates acting outside of the just-released timetable for the upcoming elections in the country.According to NEC boss Madam Davietta Brown Lansanah, “all political parties, coalition, collaboration and independent candidates must respect the scheduled for the campaign, which is from August 5 to October 8 for this year’s presidential and legislative elections.”",16/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/violating-electoral-laws-with-impunity-the-case-of-politicians-and-pre-campaign-in-liberia/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Explainer: The state of Liberia’s 2022 National Housing and Population Census,Gloria Wleh,"Census involves the complete enumeration of the population of a country. It shows the number of household members, tribal groups, and religions.Its results are used to impact programs, planning and policies for the welfare of the development of a country.Article 39 of the 1986 constitution of Liberia states that “the Legislature shall cause a census of the Republic to be undertaken every ten (10) years.” Since its independence in 1847, according to the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LIGIS), Liberia has conducted four censuses, with 1,016 in 1962, 1,503 in 1974, 2,102 in 1984, and 3,477 in 2008, respectively.By law, the next census was expected to have been conducted in 2018. Still, according to the United Nations Missions in Liberia’ (UNMIL) February 21, 2018 report, which was extracted from the Daily Observer, “the House of Representatives and the Senate decided to postpone the March 26, 2018, scheduled national census to an undetermined future date because the government cannot raise its share of 50 per cent of the USD20 million needed to carry out the national census.”Controversy over postponementThe new date for the organisation of the country’s census was not without controversy.An AllAfrica August 31, 2022, report explained that “the Liberian Senate, after a lengthy plenary discussion on June 16, 2022, moved the census to March 18 to 30, 2023, pending a concurrence by the House of Representatives, although the Liberia Institute for Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) had proposed 16 to 28 October 2022 for the conduct of the 2022 census.”The report also showed that on July 25, 2022, International Partners, including ECOWAS and the United Nations, wrote a letter that was signed by UN Resident Coordinator Niels Scott and co-signed by Finance & Development Planning Minister Samuel D. Tweah, Jr., who chairs LISGIS board, advising President Weah about the financial implications and ramifications if the census is postponed to March 2023.The partners argued that the obligatory payments to census staff would be negatively impacted if the census is delayed further.They indicated the postponement would also affect the loan agreement between Liberia and Ghana regarding providing 21,000 tablets and power banks, respectively.The partners also warned about donor fatigue regarding the payment of nearly US$800,000 if the census isn’t held in October. A postponement to December means the government and its partners must raise US$2 million amid global economic challenges.In total, more than US$8.8 million would have been lost if the census wasn’t held in October,” the report indicated.On August 10, 2022, President George Weah formally wrote to Members of the 54th Legislature to convene a Special or Extraordinary Session for 30 days to discuss, among many things, “the setting of a new census date.”A Daily Observer report quoted President Weah as saying, “the postponement of the Census from October 2022 to November 2022 will create an added staff cost of US$139,000; December 2022, is staff cost of US$278,000; and in March 2023, a staff cost of US$695,000.Through south-south cooperation, the Government of Ghana loaned the Government of Liberia 21,000 electronic data collection tablets and accessories, which are to be returned at the end of October 2022.If the census were not in October 2022, these devices would be returned, and the Government of Liberia will have to purchase its electronic tablets at US$5,355,000. Also, the financial commitment by donors may not be fulfilled if the census was not conducted in October 2022,” the President noted.On September 15, 2022, President George Weah signed into law a Joint Resolution of the National Legislature for the conduct of the National Housing and Population Census, following a joint resolution from the Senate and House of Representatives authorizing the Executive Branch of Government to conduct the National Census from October 24 to November 7, 2022.But according to an October 21, 2022, publication of the Daily Observer Newspaper report, with just four days to kick off the fifth and first digital National Population and Housing Census (NPHC), on 20th October 2022, the census was postponed by 15 days following a consensual decision reached during a leadership meeting with authorities of the Liberia Institute for Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) and the head of Liberia's Census Fund the UNFPA. As a result, President Weah, by proclamation, declared Friday, November 11, 2022, as ""National Census Day,"" and it was observed throughout the Republic as a National Holiday.The date is fixed; thus, new challenges set inNovember 22, 2022, Frontpage Africa publication authored that “the initial ten days stipulated for the conduct of the 2022 national population and housing census elapsed, but only 40,027 people, representing less than five per cent of the estimate, were counted.”The slow pace of the counting, according to LISGIS, was mainly due to “logistical challenges and difficulties in reaching hard-to-reach counties in the Southeast,” the report added.DUBAWA spoke with a few Liberians about what they make of the drama surrounding the 2022 national census and how they feel about the entire exercise:“I feel awful about how this whole census business is going. After they told us to stay home, my house of six human beings has not even been counted. I don’t trust whatever result LIGIS may come up with, and I'm not interested because the news outside there has not been so encouraging,” Benaweh Harris, a Towel Hill, Margibi County resident, said.A resident of Central Monrovia, Alice Weegar, also stated, “they never count my children and me. They only came to my house and marked it. Since they left, they haven't come back to count us. They’re not doing well at all.”Apart from the difficulties in getting people to count, there were also many discrepancies, complaints about corruption, frustrations, disenchantments and misunderstanding that characterised the entire 2022 census process.Enumerators and supervisors have protested across the country and expressed distrust in the conduct of the census. The former Acting Director General of LIGIS, Wilmot Smith and his Deputy, Alex Williams, were sacked by President George Weah on November 14, 2022, on administrative grounds.The Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC), however, on June 16, 2022, issued its “Final Report on LISGIS Corruption Investigation.”The LACC report, in its nine-count findings and analysis, showed that the Director General of LISGIS, Francis Wreh, his Deputy Director General for Administration, Lawrence George, former Deputy Director General for Information Coordination Wilmot-Smith, among other high-ranking officials, made several illegal monetary transactions intended for the National Housing and Population Census (NHPC), for which their prosecutions were recommendation by the LACC.Census results and matters arisingJustina Harris, the Communication Director of LIGIS, disclosed to DUBAWA through a telephone interview on Thursday, January 19, 2023, that “by next week, the provisional results will be out.As for the final results, it will take months before they can be out because a lot of things still need to be done,” she stated.Meanwhile, in a WhatsApp call interview with DUBAWA on February 4, 2022, former Deputy Director General for Statistics and Data Processing of LISGIS, Alex Williams, said, “corruption took the total stage while I was at LISGIS. I wrote multiple communications about the situation, but there was no result, and so, on November 12, 2022, I tendered my letter of resignation to the board of directors of LIGIS. Unfortunately, on November 14, two days after I resigned, I saw on the Executive Mansion that I was dismissed.”Williams, who labelled the 2022 census as “a flaw, failure and an embarrassment to Liberia,"" stated, “the census results could not have been announced the time it should have because there are no real results and people have to take time to manipulate the results by adding random numbers.”“I want to tell the folks at LIGIS to be honest to the Liberian people and tell them that they (LISGIS) haven’t done a good job. The Liberian people themselves shouldn’t accept any result coming from LISGIS. The new government should conduct a new census that would be more scientific, legitimate and realistic,” Williams indicated.He explained that “one of the fundamental reasons why the census is conducted is to impact programs, planning and policies for the welfare of the development of the country.”“The census results should be utilised for setting a threshold, after which the National Elections Commission (NEC) should use for electoral constituency demarcation before voter registration. That constitutional provision also will not be satisfied in the upcoming elections because of the timing and the inept nature of those at LIGIS. This could lead to the manipulation of census results for political reasons,” Williams averred.''The researcher produced this explainer per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship in partnership with The Stage Media - Liberia, to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.''",16/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/explainer-the-state-of-liberias-2022-national-housing-and-population-census/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is false to suggest rice riot took place in 1980,Varney Dukuly,"Claim: “When the rice took place in 1980, I was only 13 years old,” said President Weah on Monday, January 30, 2023, during his final state of the nation address for his first term.Verdict: False. The rice riot did not occur in 1980 but in 1979 (April 14). Independent reports bear records of these facts.Full TextOn Monday, January 30, 2023, many Liberians had the opportunity again to listen to their President delivering the nation's state before members of parliament.President George Weah’s address on Capitol Hill marks his final ‘State of the nation address’ (SONA) of his first term in office. Weah was constitutionally inaugurated into office on January 22, 2018, to provide leadership for the country for six years.The President’s SONA, which gives an idea of the actual state of the nation, also focuses on his Legislative programs for the preceding year. It also considers the expenditure and income of the economy, which fulfils the 1986 constitution of the Republic.During his address to citizens and foreign residents, the President claimed that the famous ‘Rice riot’ occurred in 1980. He said, “I was only 13 years old.”His statement reminded the youth across the country about the ugly past of Liberia’s history, especially in political times, urging them not to allow themselves to be contaminated by everyday politics.Given the historical ties this rice riot signals to the nation and its people, DUBAWA considers it vital to explore the subject further and verify the year it happened.VerificationEndowed with many natural resources like gold, diamond, and iron ore, Liberia is also rich in fertile soil.Most Liberian households eat rice for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Interestingly, however, the vast majority of the rice eaten by citizens is not produced in Liberia.The rice riot is one of the largest riots Liberia has ever experienced. The riot led to a dozen deaths and many more injuries following the rice price increment by the then President, William R. Tolbert.Rice riot image in Liberia.Interestingly, Mr Weah maintained that the famous ‘Rice Riot’ took place in 1980, as contained in his speech posted on the Executive Mansion's official Facebook page name and styled as ‘SONA’ part 3.“When the rice took place in 1980, I was only 13 years old,” said President Weah on Monday, January 30, 2023, during his final state of the nation address for his first term.Contrary to the claim by President Weah that the rice riot took place in 1980 when he was just 13 years, online research indicates the riot took place a year earlier.Attempts by DUBAWA to discover the information or the actual date of the incident in Parliament proved futile. However, after further search, DUBAWA accessed a New York Times publication detailing the tall order associated with the event and how costly it was for the nation and its people.The report was written a month after the rice riot and was dated May 30, 1979.Other online searches, including the Liberia News Agency, led DUBAWA to multiple publications that credited the rice riot in 1979, as seen here.However, in 1980, a year after the rice riot, there was the Liberia coup, which led to the overthrow and murder of President William Tolbert.ConclusionPresidential proclamations in the context of SONA are considered historical data, which must be accurate. Mr Weah's claims that Liberia’s rice riot occurred in 1980 are inaccurate, given the evidence above.The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with OK FM to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",10/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/it-is-false-to-suggest-rice-riot-took-place-in-1980/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Viral Shell plc recruitment on WhatsApp, false",Bryan B. Dioh Jr,"Claim: A WhatsApp message containing a link to a website purporting to be the British multinational oil and gas company Shell claims that the company offers jobs for skilled and unskilled labourers.Verdict: False. The WhatsApp link claiming that Shell offers jobs for 2023 is fake and misleading. The Link, upon verification, is not for the official company.Full TextA WhatsApp message containing a link to a website purporting to be the British multinational oil and gas company Shell states that the company offers jobs for skilled and unskilled labourers.A screenshot of the WhatsApp message.Once you open the link in the WhatsApp message, it takes you to a website, and the front page shows an image of individuals wearing the reflected work suit and the company logo.The site also contains an application form with questions such as “Select Title, Your First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Email address, and Country.”It is important to note that however applicants answer these questions, they will be directed to another step which automatically “congratulates” and qualifies the applicant to work with the company. When the steps are completed, applicants are again asked to share the link with “five people or 15 friends on WhatsApp.” After the green verification bar is filled, he or she will also be redirected automatically to the company’s appointment page.Applicants are also told that after these processes, they will receive a confirmation email within 24 hours after a successful application.VerificationScamAdviser.com, a verification tool used to certify the originality of websites and links, was used to analyse the authenticity oflinks. Upon analysis, findings show that the alleged Shell website was suspicious and was rated with a “very bad trust” tag and flagged up as a link associated with scammers.A screenshot of a fact-check report conducted by the researcher on ScamAdviser.Further research established that the website of the British multinational company Shell Group of Companies does not carry anything like “TABNAIJA” in its URL. The Company does have jobs for skilled and unskilled labourers on their website, but the requirements for these jobs are not to fill out an application form and are in contrast to what was specified on the false link. The real company is also aware of these scam alerts. It has issued a caution on its website about people or sites claiming to be offering jobs at their company.“Please note that Shell Group of companies (nor any of the organisations that recruit on our behalf) never ask for any money or payments from applicants at any point in the recruitment process. All individuals who successfully gain an offer of employment from a Shell Group company, whether directly or indirectly, are always required to undergo a formal recruitment process. All communications should originate from a verifiable Shell e-mail address and not from an Internet e-mail address, e.g., Hotmail, yahoo etc.”Recruitment scamsAccording to the Shell Group company's official site, the fraud scam section states:“The job offers come from organisations falsely pretending to recruit on behalf of Shell Group companies or by people claiming to work for or be affiliated to a Shell Group company. These propositions notify individuals that their qualifications were found suitable to work as an employee (local or expatriate) for a Shell Group company and solicit the transfer of significant sums of money to pay for work permits, insurance policies, etc.”Meanwhile, the company asks those wanting to seek jobs from them to take into consideration that they do not request money from applicants at any point in the recruitment process.Internet users are cautioned against opening these viral links.ConclusionBased on research, our finding reveals the link in the WhatsApp message has a URL that contains words such as “tabnaija” which cannot be found anywhere in the original link of Shell Group.It has the potential to compromise people's private information, meaning some webpages, like that of the purported Shell Oil and Gas recruitment site, is a risk to personal devices and may interfere with the privacy of individuals who access them at any given point. At times, it may encrypt viruses in their devices, scam them or infuse malware or virus in devices.",10/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/viral-shell-plc-recruitment-on-whatsapp-false/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The economics of rice politics in Liberia and Weah’s role in it,Gloria Wleh,"With General and Presidential Elections scheduled for October 10, 2023, the government of Liberia, through the Ministry of Information Cultural Affairs and Tourism (MICAT) on January 13, 2022, posted what it calls the “Years-in-Reveiw” of President George Weah from 2018-2022. The post, among several other achievements of President Weah, stated, ""President Weah kept the price of rice at US$13 per 25kg bag for almost five years.”The claim on the first roll of the fifth section of the post, captioned “RICE PRICE STABILITY”, was of paramount interest to DUBAWA because of the significant place rice occupies in Liberia’s politics of economics.In April 1979, the rice riots in Liberia were believed to have toppled the William R. Tolbert government. There has since been no turning back for political actors in their bid to control the rice conversation, its prices and all other related matters.Early last year, the Deputy Minister for Budget Development at the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, Tanneh G. Brunson, is reported to have said, “Rice is Liberia’s staple food, but we don’t produce it.DUBAWA decided to explore the price changes of Liberia’s popular staple food and the government's role in it.To begin with, the Director of Press and Public Affairs of the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism (MICAT) was contacted through a local telephone call on January 17, 2023, to provide documented evidence about the price changes of rice. But Lawrence Fahnbulleh said, “we (MICAT) are not the ones that make up the document. It came from the sector ministries. So if you want to find out after that document that is up, go to the sector ministry.”The Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MOCI)’s official website was then visited to verify the trend of rice prices from 2018 to 2022. Still, the information surrounding that could not be established, as “trade reports”, “administrative regulations”, and “annual reports,” among several other reports, were seen to have lastly been posted almost mid-2018, of which the price of 25kg bag of rice could not be seen.On Thursday, January 19, 2023, the Director of Public Affairs of the MOCI, Jacob Parley, was contacted and informed about the current state of the MOCI’s official website. He affirmed the state of the website, saying, “it was since 2018 we updated that website.”Parley was then asked to provide documentation surrounding MICAT’s claim, and he referred DUBAWA to the Deputy Minister for Commerce & Trade, George Wolo, who also failed to assist. When DUBAWA went back to Parley for further and better information on the rice price changes, he said the minister who would help provide the data “is engaged with a lot of things right now.”Nonetheless, several local dailies and international news reports were checked to verify the trend of rice prices from 2018 to 2022.In its June 9, 2021, report, AllAfrica reported that “rice importers launched an appeal to the current government headed by President George Manneh Weah to permit an increment in the price of rice due to rising cost of importation, due to a worldwide increment in freight and the rapidly rising increase in fees for services at the National Port Authority (NPA).”The report revealed that “In a February 2018 meeting with importers, President Weah secured an agreement with importers for the price of rice to be reduced between US$2-4.“Prior to the reduction, the price of a 25kg bag of rice was US$16.00. Since February 2018, the rice price has been US$13.00.“At the end of the negotiations, the Association of Rice Importers headed by their Chairman, John Bestman, agreed to reduce the price of the 25Kg bag of rice by US $2.00,” the news report said.The Daily Observer's October 10, 2022 news report also showed that a 25kg bag of rice was sold between “L$5,000 (US$33) and L$6,000 (US$40), respectively, in Nimba.”The report further showed that “the government of Liberia has been striving to maintain the retail price of a 25kg bag of rice between US$13.50 and US$14.00.”It recorded the World bank as saying,“ In 2021, when the global price of rice fell by 7.8 per cent, the average price of a 25 kg bag of imported rice in Montserrado counties soared by 26 per cent to US$19 in 2021, up from US$15 in 2020, according to the World Bank.A leading rice importer in Via Town, Bushrod Island, explained to DUBAWA that “the price of rice increased from US$13 to US$17 as of the end of last year.”The importer, who requested anonymity, said, “the increment in the price of rice is due to the pandemic and the ongoing Russian and Ukrainian conflict and some national efforts, also.”The operator of Wesley Business Center in Waterside, a retailer, also disclosed that he buys a 25kg bag of rice for US$17 from a US$13 price as of late 2023.Though the AllAfrica news report showed that the Weah-led government made some efforts to keep rice prices at US13$ from 2018 to early 2021, DUBAWA’s conversations with some retailers and importers, as well as news reports also showed that from mid-2021, the price of a 25kg bag of rice saw some variations in prices.The Daily Observer news report by the World Bank shows the price rose to US$15 in 2020 in Montserrado alone and further up to US$19 in 2021. In 2022 at Nimba, it was sold at US$33 and US$40. October 10, 2022, the news report of Daily Observer also showed US$13.50 and US$14 in 2022.ConclusionBased on the checks, it can be said that rice prices have seen some variations over the last few years, contrary to MICAT’s claim that “President Weah has kept the price of rice at US$13 per 25kg bag for almost five (5) years.”The researcher produced this explainer per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship in partnership with The Stage Media, Liberia, to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",07/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/the-economics-of-rice-politics-in-liberia-and-weahs-role-in-it/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Weah’s Liberia:? Doctor to patient ratio not 1 to 20,000",Varney Dukuly,"Claim: The doctor-to-patient ratio under George Weah is one to 20,000, according to Activist Martin Kollie.Verdict: False! The post from Activist Martin Kollie stating that the Doctor-to-Patient ratio in Liberia under George Weah is one to 20,000 contradicts the Liberia Medical and Dental Council (LMDC) statistic that the country has a total of 920 doctors, which means the ratio mathematically is one doctor to 5,000 citizens.Full TextActivist Martin Kollie, in one of his regular Facebook posts dated January 3, 2023, quoted the WHO that the Doctor-to-Patient Ratio should be 1 to 1,000.He added that under George Manneh Weah, the narrative is worrying. According to him, at the moment in Liberia, “there is one doctor for 20,000 patients,” citing the WHO 2021/2022 HWF report as his source.He said, “It was 1 to 15,000 under Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Y’all go and put Jorweah there again. It will go up to 1 to 50,000. Crisis!!”Activist Martin Kollie, who posted the statement on January 4, 2022, on his official Facebook page, has sparked public debate among Facebook users.Some Facebook users agreed with Kollie over his claim, while others branded the post as political and false.Images: Screenshot from Facebook users.Liberia's fragile health sector has been exposed on two different occasions, both in 2014 and 2019. The former was due to the deadly Ebola virus outbreak leading to the deaths of scores of citizens.The country reported the highest number of Ebola cases in the West African region. Though Liberia has been declared free of Ebola, its adverse effects remain fresh in the minds of ordinary people.Hit by the global Covid-19 in 2020, the nation, as of January 11 (2023), recorded a total number of 294 deaths and total confirmed cases at 8,043.Like other nations of the world, COVID also affected the cost of living for ordinary Liberians.With the challenges associated with the health implications mentioned above, we decided to verify the claim by activist Martin Kollie on his official Facebook page.VerificationThe doctor-to-patient ratio refers to the number of available doctors per every 10,000 inhabitants in a population, in a given year, for a given country, territory, or geographic area. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a one to 1,000 doctor-to-patient ratios for adequate healthcare service.With this recommendation from the WHO, it is critical to examine the truth behind the claim.Activist Kollie, in his statement, specifically referenced the 2021/2022 Health Workforce (HWF report) as his source. But, online research for the 2021/2022 HWF report seems inaccessible.This researcher reached out to the WHO local office to access the report, but it was not provided despite many efforts. However, the WHO, according to an official working with the Ministry of Health, Chester Smith, the global health institution, does not release such national data to individuals.The World Health Organization measurement method concerning data collection is often drawn from its country offices based on information reported by the national health authority.However, the national health authority in Liberia, charged with feeding the WHO with national data, rubbished the claim.The Deputy Minister for Planning and Research at the Ministry of Health, A. Vaifee Tulay, said that on record, there are 920 medical doctors currently in Liberia, contrary to the claim from Kollie.“Statistically, when one measures the above number of Medical doctors against the nation's estimated 4.8 million population, you will have the figure of about 5,000 patients to 1 Doctor,” A. Vaifee Tulay noted.When asked about the WHO 2021/2022 HWF report, Deputy Minister Tulay maintained that such a report has not reached his desk, “Not to my knowledge, maybe it is on its way.”Interestingly, when contacted, Kollie, who claimed to have gathered his information from the World Health Organization HWF, backpedalled on his previous source.As indicated below, the claimant referred DUBAWA to the Liberia Medical and Dental Council report.Image: Screenshot from messenger conversation.Our examination revealed that the latest data released by the Liberia Medical and Dental Council on the number of doctors in the country says otherwise.“The total number of Liberian doctors is 917; of the 917, 407 had been active from 2020/2022 while others had passed, others retired from practising, and others were not coming to renew their license. So we have 510 that fall in this category,” said the Liberia Medical Dental Council report.On the number of foreign doctors practising and visiting Liberia, the report states that there are 1,170 foreign doctors registered with the Medical Council. Of the 1,170, only 517 had been active since 2020.“Most of the rest have returned without knowledge of the council while others also passed,” said the Liberia Medical and Dental Council.But in 2016, the Medical and Dental Council, under President Sirleaf’s administration, released a report that came close to the claimant's position on the doctor-to-patient ratio in Liberia.We cannot guarantee whether this report, released eight years ago, was reliable because the author failed to cite the particular year.Online research brought DUBAWA closer to this 2016 Liberia Medical and Dental report referenced by ‘Yale.’The Liberia Medical Dental Council, among other things, noted that the total number of Medical doctors who are currently with the Council from 2020/2022 is 924, a figure that slightly contradicts the Deputy Minister of Health, who put the total number of doctors in Liberia at 920.ConclusionGiven the nature of such a claim and the lack of evidence to back it, the claim is deemed false. In view of the fact that there are between 920 and 947 medical doctors to 4.8 million citizens, a ratio of one doctor to 5,000 patients, the claim by Maerin Kollie that the doctor-patient ratio in Liberia is one to 20,000 is false.The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with OK FM to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",06/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/in-weahs-liberia-doctor-to-patient-ratio-not-1-to-20000/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Australia visa and job application claim in viral WhatsApp message false?,Gloria Wleh,"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims that the Australian government has announced visa sponsorship and jobs in Australia for 2023.Verdict: False! Checks on the Australia immigration office website provide a different process for visa and job applications in Australia.Full TextA viral WhatsApp message claims that the government of Australia is offering visa sponsorship and jobs in 2023.Screenshot of the viral WhatsApp message.The message, as expected from many parts of the global south, was mandated to be shared with five groups or 15 friends on WhatsApp, after which applicants will be redirected automatically to the visa form, which the website stated would be followed by a confirmation code within 24 hours.Screenshot of the mandate.DUBAWA completed the sharing process to access the visa form and verify its truthfulness. After the share column reaches 100%, a print form automatically pops up, sharing the same link with the share options.Clicking on the print form showed up without a specific link. However, it brought Premier Bet Register and later a page accepting applications to offer temporary permits for caregivers in Canada, not the visa form as previously stated.The content in the WhatsApp message further reads as follows: “The government is also looking for Nationals and International applicants who can fill the Shortage of jobs in Australia. Australian Public services are giving out thousands of jobs.”The message, however, ends with a link that, when clicked, takes applicants to an application form asking for personal information.VerificationThe website was analysed on Scamdoc, which showed a “1% very bad trust index.” The domain is seen to have been created in Canada, while the creation date is seen to have been in 2022, while the expiration date is in 2024.However, though ScamDoc site publishers do not influence the rating of a specific domain or URL, the URL in the WhatsApp message directs users to a page where they are asked to provide personal details like names, email, and country of origin, among others.A check of the website shows that the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which shows the address of a given resource on the world wide web, does not have the .gov.au domain which is used by the official website of the Australian Government Department of Employment and Workplace Relations dewr.gov.au.The Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s official website, dfat.gov.au, also carries the .gov.au that the typical Australian government website - unlike the website of the viral WhatsApp message- carries.Further checks on the immigration and home affairs section of the Australian government website spell out the conditions under which a visa and jobs can be offered, and those procedures are completely different from the ones being shared in the viral message.DUBAWA also discovered that the site has an additional ‘Secure Sockets Layer’ (SSL certificate) which enables it to carry https to convince users that it is credible. But according to WebTitan, HTTPS or an SSL certificate alone is not a guarantee that the website is secure and can be trusted.Additional checks show that “ly” is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Libyan government and not the Australian government.According to Marcaria.com Network, Domain Registration in Australia, to register a website in Australia, one will have to “enter the .COM.AU” and/or “.NET.AU” domain name(s) assigned to the country and not bit.ly.ConclusionChecks on the Australia Immigration website, including a website verification process of the viral message, show that the claims made in the viral message are false.The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship in partnership with The Stage Media – Liberia to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",02/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/australia-visa-and-job-application-claim-in-viral-whatsapp-message-false/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Suggesting Weah reduced Open Defecation from 42% to 38% is misleading,Varney Dukuly,"Claim: WASH Commission head says Weah’s administration reduced Open Defecation from 42% in 2018 to 38%.Verdict: Misleading. A scrutiny of the WHO data provided by Mr Bobby Whitefield shows that while it is true that Open Defecation reduced to 37.7% (38%) in 2020 under Weah, it was not 42% in 2018 when Weah came to power. It was 38.8% (39%).Full TextThe Water and Sanitation Hygiene Commission styled as the “WASH Commission”, is a state-owned institution. The commission is tasked as the principal government agency to regulate and promote Sanitation and Hygiene Services in Liberia. Open defecation (OD) refers to the percentage of the population defecating in the open, such as in fields, forests, bushes, open bodies of water, on beaches and other open spaces.In Liberia, poor sanitation, notably Open Defecation, is among issues that are not given much coverage, although it remains a critical issue in the country. It is also an explicit focus of SDG 6.2.Given the issue of Open Defecation, it is important to hear President Weah talk to the nation about the subject and the efforts government is making to improve sanitation. The President’s assurances will be hinged on information provided by the only Water and Sanitation & Hygiene Commission in Liberia headed by Mr Bobby Whitefield.Recently, Whitefield told the state broadcaster, ELBC, that President George Weah will have so much to mention about the commission when he delivers his annual message to the nation on January 30.In an interview with State Radio, Whitefield stated that “the President will be able to indicate to Liberians in his annual message that under his leadership, the country has cut down the open defecation rate from 42% to 38%.”He added: “Under the leadership of President Weah, the country has cut down the open defecation rate from 42% to 38%.” The Weah-led administration took office in 2018 and is currently still in power; Whitefield’s statement suggests that the reduction occurred between 2018 and 2023.He maintained that the latest statistic is huge progress, adding, “it is expected to add colours to the Liberian leader's State of the Nation address.”Image Source:https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?]The WASH Boss made the statement on Thursday, January 12, 2023, on the Super Morning Show, a live radio program on the Liberia Broadcasting System. He can be heard during the 37 mins of the program, which lasted for 54:04 sec.The particular statement followed a question, “if the President was to mention WASH Commission in his annual message, what would be the compelling storyline?” asked the host.DUBAWA reached out to Bobby Whitefield on WhatsApp to clarify his statement about the reduction in open defecation. He referred to the latest Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) Report as his source.“This is the latest Joint Monitoring Program report (JMP) report conducted by WHO and UNICEF and measures access to water, sanitation and hygiene.”Image: Screenshot of the conversation.Given the urgent need for better sanitation and a further reduction of open defecation in Liberia, DUBAWA decided to explore the matter and assess the data available from statutory institutions and international organizations.Using the document given us by Whitfield, we were able to extract information that partly confirms his statement. The latest WHO/UNICEF 2020 Joint Monitoring Program Report was published in 2020 and updated in 2021.Image: Screenshot of data summary (OD highlighted in the blue box).According to the report, Open defecation (OD) reached 37.7%, approximately 38%, as stated by Whitefield. However, the same report suggests that in 2018 OD was 38.8, not 42 as he claimed.We consulted other credible sources to compare the data available on OD in Liberia.According to data from the World Bank, open defecation was at 39% in 2018 and has fallen steadily up to 2020. The Bank’s data for people practising open defecation in Liberia covers the year 2000 to 2020.Also, Wateraid Liberia, on Jan 23, 2023, posted on its official Twitter page that “38% of the people in Liberia practice open defecation, and this results in sanitation-related diseases.”Apart from these Facebook and Twitter posts from Wateraid, there is no latest report or data beyond 2020 on Liberia for open defecation that can be accessed to authenticate Whitefield’s assertion.Can Weah be credited for the 42% to 38% reduction in Open Defecation?President George Weah ascended to the Liberian Presidency on January 22, 2018, following an overwhelming victory in the 2017 Presidential and Legislative Elections in Liberia, which marks the first major transition in post-war Liberia.Open defecation in Liberia, as of 2018, was at 38.8%, with a total population of 1,868,885.Image: 2018 JMP data on OD.By 2020, the Liberian population had increased to 1,905,886, and the OD rate had gone down to 37.7%, according to the JMP report 2020.Image: 2020 JMP data on OD.ConclusionA scrutiny of the data provided by Bobby Whitfield shows that while it is true OD may have reduced to 37% in 2020 during Mr Weah's presidency, it was not 42% in 2018, as he stated. Rather it was 38.8%.It is expected that government and its development partners will work hand-in-hand to reduce open defecation if it cannot stop it completely.The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame Karikari Fellowship partnership with OK FM to facilitate the ethics of “Truth” in Journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",02/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/suggesting-weah-reduced-open-defecation-from-42-to-38-is-misleading/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Explainer: Weah’s controversial opinion poll; real or phantom?,Varney Dukuly,"In the lead-up to the 2023 Presidential and Legislative elections in Liberia, major political actors have begun massive campaigns for their flagbearers in the hope of winning the upcoming elections.The incumbent President, George Weah, has been touted by many of his supporters, including Assistant Agriculture Minister Alvin Wesseh, as the most favourable aspirant for the “Liberian Presidency.”Photo: Assistant Agriculture Minister, Alvin Wesseh (Image source: https://www.facebook.com/photo/?).Wesseh, among other things, stated that opinion polls conducted by local media institutions and some unnamed international organisations put Mr Weah ahead of rival politicians.An Assistant Minister for Agriculture made the latest claim bordering on the incumbent standing a better chance of winning on Friday, January 6, 2023.“‘International Organisations have conducted voter perception polls around the country, which shows that the incumbent President is in the lead of other contenders,” said Wesseh.The comments by the minister, who is also the Vice Chairperson of the ‘Congress for Democratic Change,’ a constituent party within the Coalition government, spanned from 48:48 sec to 50:04 sec during the second and final lap of the OK Conversation radio show.Interestingly, the Agriculture Minister failed to substantiate his claim even when he was repeatedly challenged to name the international organisation involved in the opinion poll.His comment comes on the heels of a similar statement by his party’s youth league first-round-victory-for-weah-cdc-youth-league-leader-declares/. Even more worrying is the comment by the youth leader that in 2023 they will accept nothing less than a first-round victory for the incumbent President George Weah.DUBAWA decided to examine the claim and understand what opinion polls play in the country’s electoral process. This researcher contacted Mr Wesseh to confirm from which organisation he had sourced the information, but he was not forthcoming with any information.Further investigations conducted by DUBAWA on the websites of ECOWAS, Carter Center, Democracy International, National Democratic Institute and many other websites to ascertain if, indeed, some international organisation has conducted an election poll on Liberia’s upcoming election proved futile.The closest DUBAWA came to finding anything relating to the survey being talked about by government spokespersons was an online research report published by BTI in 2022. BTI project is a think-tank group comprising nearly 300 country and regional experts from leading universities worldwide. The project analyses and compares transformation processes towards democracy and inclusive market economy worldwide. A section of the report, on page 14, titled, Political and Social Integration, states that,“Four Afrobarometer surveys since 2008 found approval of democracy following a bell curve. Initially high after the civil war, dissatisfaction with leaders and the desire for strong leadership on Ebola has entailed a steady reduction. Liberians, in principle, support democratic institutions and leadership elections in particular. 70% prefer democracy to any other kind of government and reject authoritarian alternatives like military rule (73%). They believe that Liberia is more democratic now than three years ago, which likely reflects the eventual election victory of George Weah. At the same time, dissatisfaction with the way democracy is working in the country is increasing. Complaints include impunity for elite corruption, a lack of concern among elites for ordinary Liberians, and a lack of order. ”The highlighted section of the above quote is similar to the statement Wesseh made but in a completely different context. The afrobarometer survey talked about the previous elections, not the upcoming ones, as Wesseh would have us believe. The Afrobarometer assessment stated that “Liberia is more democratic now than three years ago.” Furthermore, the report is grounded on Liberians’ readings on the democratic state of the country.Could this be the same opinion poll being touted by government spokespersons?This explainer will explore opinion polls' role in elections and the general democratic culture in Liberia. It will also explore why this particular survey or opinion poll should be investigated, whether real or charade.The Executive Director of the Institute for Research and Democratic Development (IREDD), Mathias Yeaney, weighs in on the latest claim made by Minister Wesseh with respect to the 2023 opinion polls debate for Mr Weah. IREDD works to promote sustainable democracy and development through informed policy research.In a write-up to DUBAWA, Yeaney said participants for opinion polls are drawn from different localities, disaggregated by gender, age and regions with different political affiliations, which makes it important for people to know the details of an opinion poll.“Any opinion poll conducted in a political party’s stronghold is to confirm whether it remains a stronghold,” he said in response to questions asked by DUBAWA.“However, if you want an objective opinion poll report, you must conduct it across other areas, mainly in heavily contended areas.”When asked about the sponsors of opinion polls, Yeaney, who has been a civil society actor and researcher in the country for close to a decade, added that usually, anyone can sponsor the study.“However, whether the sponsor wants a say or a particular result coming from the study, then there is a problem,” he said, “Anyone can sponsor an OP, but the outcome must be objective. No manipulation. It is also important to make the Sponsored public.”Providing a background of the role Opinion polls have played in Liberia’s election process, Mr Yeaney said, “Opinion polls, whether scientific or unscientific, have had no bearing on the outcome of electioneering activities in the country.”He cited that most opinion polls conducted in urban areas like the nation’s capital, Monrovia, do not reflect the views of the ordinary people in rural Liberia.“If the opinion were something to go by, then, in 2005, President George Weah would have won over former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf because all the OP conducted, whether on the radio or through other means, proved that he was going to win, but at the end of the day, Madam Sirleaf flogged him in the election,” said Yeaney.The IREDD Executive Director explained that the country has a history where citizens make electioneering decisions based on regional and traditional lines, not opinion polls, as is insinuated.One of the major opposition political parties, the ‘Unity Party’ of former Vice President Joseph Boakai, termed the claim from Minister Wesseh as “Absolute nonsense.”In a conversation with DUBAWA, a member of the intellectual class in Liberia said the claim by Wesseh is a calculated attempt by the ruling establishment to confuse the sound democratic decision of the Liberian people.Robert Doe: “It is a propaganda message. Well, if you are not smart and intellectual as I am, you will fall prey to it. I challenge Assistant Minister Wesseh to prove his claim about the International Organisation Opinion Polls.”Doe, who was also a one-time civil society actor of the erstwhile “Potential Youths,” said the government's fate would be decided at the ballot box and not by opinion polls.The UP secretary general, Amos Tweh, questioned the authenticity of the opinion polls.He said it is either a ghost survey or the usual CDC machinations to steal or thwart the democratic will of the people, using such deceptive comments to justify their grand design.ConclusionIt is fair to state that Opinion Polls, though important, do not necessarily reflect the outcome of elections in Liberia and, more importantly, the details of the Opinion Polls, including the total population used, and the survey sponsors. The outcome must be made public as part of efforts to grow the democratic culture of the country.",19/01/2023,https://dubawa.org/explainer-weahs-controversial-opinion-poll-real-or-phantom/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liberia not the only eligible country to miss $1.2bn MCC grant,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: “All Countries that passed the MCC scorecard received hundreds of millions of dollars, except Liberia.”Verdict: False! Liberia is not the only country that failed to receive a grant from MCC after passing its scorecards.Full TextA staunch critic of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) government under the leadership of President George Weah has claimed that all countries that passed the just released MCC scorecard received hundreds of millions of United States dollars except Liberia.According to Henry Costa, Liberia missed out on the MCC grant due to the poor leadership credentials of President George Weah.He made the claim when he appeared on a local radio talk show, the OKay Morning Rush, aired on Okay 99.5FM upon returning to the country.The show, which was carried live on the station’s official Facebook page, had 1.2k comments, 17.1k viewers and over 550 emojis.The assertion was made at 51:34-47 seconds within the over one-hour show on Tuesday, January 3, 2023.VerificationSince the issue of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has become a talking point for Liberians, especially after the first and highest pass made by the Liberian government under the Weah-led regime, DUBAWA decided to subject the claim by Henry Costa to scrutiny.What is Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)?The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is an innovative and independent U.S. foreign assistance agency that is helping lead the fight against global poverty. The MCC was created by the U.S. Congress in January 2004 with strong bipartisan support and has changed the conversation on how best to deliver smart U.S. foreign assistance by focusing on good policies, country ownership, and results. MCC provides time-limited grants by promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, and strengthening institutions of countries that are deemed to have passed the MCC scorecards.When did Liberia join the MCC?Liberia joined the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) in 2006 under President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's leadership; since then, the country has been a part of the program.Under the presidency of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Liberia passed the scorecards on two occasions, in 2013 and 2017. Here are the 12-year scorecards of Liberia under President Sirleaf.After passing the MCC in 2013, the Government of Liberia and the United States Government, through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Liberia in October 2015, signed a US$257million compact with a direct focus on rebuilding the country’s broken electricity sector and the construction of a new 48-inch diameter Raw Water Pipeline between Mt. Coffee and the White Plains Water Treatment Plant to replace a damaged 36-inch diameter pipeline that had not been in use since Liberia’s civil war. The benefits from this compact ended on January 20, 2021.Under the George Weah-led administration, the Liberian government in 2022/2023 passed 12 out of 20 indicators of the MCC scorecard.This pass received massive media reports through the instrumentality of the government of Liberia, as seen here and here.Is Liberia among the countries eligible for the grant?Though Liberia is part of the countries that passed the recently released scorecard of the MCC, Liberia is not among the countries eligible to benefit from the grant. One hundred countries passed the 2022/2023 MCC scorecard. Out of this number, only 62 countries were eligible for the grant under the low-income category, while under the lower middle-income category, four countries were eligible for the grants: Algeria, Eswatini, Indonesia and Samoa.Eligible countries for the grantsEven though 62 countries have been deemed eligible, only a few were announced as grant beneficiaries. In a December 14, 2022, statement issued by United States President Joseph Biden on behalf of the MCC’s Board, $1.2 billion was announced for grant beneficiaries. Liberia was omitted from the list of beneficiaries, and so were other countries.Biden said in connection with the announcement of grants, “Along with selecting countries for new grant programs, MCC’s Board also reselected C?te d’Ivoire as eligible for a concurrent regional compact program; Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and Zambia for compact development; and Kiribati for threshold program development. The Board also reaffirmed its support for continuing compact development in Belize. MCC regularly reviews its partner countries’ policy performance throughout developing and implementing a compact or threshold program.”Per this statement, Liberia was not the only country left out of receiving the grant from the MCC. Countries like Nigeria, Somalia, Malawi, Lesotho, Ghana, Cape Verde and many others were not selected, even though all of them were eligible.Still unsatisfied with the statement, DUBAWA reached out to the head of the MCC-Liberia compact, Mr Monie R. Captan, to find out why Liberia was omitted. Mr Monie R. Captan told DUBAWA in a WhatsApp conversation that when a country becomes eligible, it does not mean it will be selected automatically, adding that there are limited funds and selection is competitive among those deemed to be eligible.Mr Captain further stated, “the selection is not every year, so it is possible we might get selected next year. Each compact has a separate project. The last compact had to do with energy, and the compact closed in 2021 when we completed the project.”ConclusionBased on all of the research conducted by DUBAWA with evidence from the Millennium Challenge Corporation official site, it is safe to say that the claim made by Henry Costa that Liberia is the only country that did not receive an MCC grant after passing its scorecard is false.",17/01/2023,https://dubawa.org/liberia-not-the-only-eligible-country-to-miss-1-2bn-mcc-grant/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Public Sector Investment not US$27million when George Weah became Liberia’s President,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: “We (CDC) took over from a place where they (Past Government, UP) had only US$ 27 million for public sector investment.”Verdict: False! Public Sector Investment was not US$ 27 million when George Weah became President. Instead, it was US$55 - 280,850, according to the 2017/18 National Budget.Full TextWith less than ten months to Liberia’s Presidential and legislative elections, members of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) headed by President George Weah have been trumpeting the achievements of the regime in the last five years with reasons why they think the government should be retained in office.The latest such campaign was displayed recently by Assistant Minister for Planning at the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP), Benedict Kolubah when he engaged the secretary of the opposition and immediate past governing party, Unity Party (UP), headed by then President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.On January 2, 2023, the two gentlemen faced each other on a local radio station, Okay 99.5FM, in a debate to compare and contrast the achievements of the two regimes.The show was live on the media outlet’s official Facebook page with over 730 comments, 241 emojis, 7.3k viewers, and 90 shares.During the debate, Assistant Minister Benedict Kolubah claimed that the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) took over the country from the Unity party at a point when Public Sector investment was US$ 27 million.Assistant Minister Kolubah made the claim at 2:10:40-51 seconds of the over two hours show.The Assistant Finance Minister said, “we picked up from a system without space to invest in the country. The space on the budget was just for recurrent expenditure. We picked up from a place where there was only US$ 27 million for public sector investment.”Assistant Minister Kolubah indicated that the Unity Party-led government inherited a broken economy at the time. He indicated they had all the opportunities to improve the country’s economy but did not do enough in the country's and its people's best interest.VerificationDue to the importance of the claim in relation to the country’s progress under the Weah-led administration, DUBAWA embarked on an investigation to ascertain the facts about the claim.Public Sector Investment is the expenditure incurred by the government in areas such as infrastructure, agriculture, housing and other related areas.It is important to state that the Weah-led CDC government was sworn into office in 2018 after winning the 2017 General elections.To investigate the statement, DUBAWA needed to compare data from the final year of the Sirleaf-Johnson administration to that of the first year of the CDC administration.DUBAWA first contacted the claimant through a WhatsApp chat for evidence of his claim. But the Assistant Minister, Benedict Kolubah, provided DUBAWA with a sheet of paper through WhatsApp showing, among other things, a declining trend in the Public Sector Investment Plan (PSIP) from 2013/2014 to 2017-2018, as seen below.Whatsapp conversation with the claimant.Assistant Minister Kolubah also referred DUBAWA to the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning's official website to verify his claim.DUBAWA then visited the official website of the Ministry of Finance. According to the last budget, 2017/2018, under the previous administration headed by Ms Sirleaf, public sector investment for the fiscal year 2016/2017 was at US$62,398,129 and 2017/18 was at 55,280,850, contrary to what the Assistant Minister claimed as seen below:Excerpts of 2017-18 Budget Statement.This information is found on page 550 of the country’s National Budget for the fiscal year 2017-2018 under Annex four with the caption Public Sector Investment plan. It contains every item and all its allocations.DUBAWA also pulled out the first budget prepared under the CDC-led administration in 2018-2019, and according to that budget, PSIP was placed at US$58,762,836.Excerpts of 2018-19 Budget Statement.ConclusionBased on evidence from the country’s National Budget for the fiscal year 2017-2018 and the Minister’s evidence provided, it is safe to say that the assertion made by Assistant Minister Benedict Kolubah that Public sector Investment was at US$27million when the CDC-led government took over from the then Unity Party government is false. It was at US$62,398,129 in 2016/2017 and US$55,280,850 in 2017/18.",12/01/2023,https://dubawa.org/public-sector-investment-not-us27million-when-george-weah-became-liberias-president/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Explainer: Tracking the law on presidential travels and Weah’s 48-days of globe-trotting,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"According to rule 13, Liberia's government's revised travel ordinance of 2016/2017, no trip out of the country should exceed more than seven days.The law ordinance states, “Total number of days spent on any particular trip shall not exceed seven days for which per diem and accommodation shall be funded by the Government of Liberia.”But it seems the current trip by President George Weah to the United States of America is in clear violation of this law.The President attended the US-Africa Summit and has been out of the country since November 1, 2022. After 48 days out of the jurisdiction, he returned on December 19, 2022, 41 days in excess of the approved number of days a government official can be out of the country.Liberia’s president, George Weah, departed the country for Morocco with some members of his government, including Chief of Protocol, Finda Bundoo, Special Aide, Sekou Kalasco, Head of the Liberia Maritime Commission, Lenn Eugene Nagbe, Youth and Sports Minister, D. Zeogar Wilson, among others.A stop followed the trip to Morocco in Egypt, where President Weah participated in the just-ended COP27, the United Nations Global Climate Change Conference, which kicked off on November 6, 2022, at the Tonino Lamborghini International Convention Center in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.This conference ran from November 6 to 8, 2022, when the Liberian President left for Qatar to join some world leaders for the official opening of the FIFA World Cup 2022.According to two separate communications sent to the Liberian Legislature, President Weah told the August body that his trip is intended to hold a series of bilateral and multilateral meetings with his counterparts and business executives.Controversy over Weah’s long absenceA government spokesman said the president’s assignments are in furtherance of the country’s development and investments agenda.Since the announcement of these trips by the CDC-led government, there have been huge criticisms by Liberians, political parties and some civil society organisations in the country.The 48-day globe-trotting adventure by President Weah has sparked heated debates in the country, with Montserrado County and member of the opposition community, Senator Abraham Darius Dillon calling on his colleagues of the Liberian Senate to launch a probe into the president’s travels.Naymote Partners for Democratic Development, an international civil society organisation in Liberia, has since expressed concern over what it termed as the long absence of President Weah from the country.According to the group’s Executive Director, Eddie Jarwolo, the Liberian leader’s prolonged absence from the country amid controversies over the conduct of the National Population and Housing Census (NPHC) is completely out of order.When DUBAWA contacted Naymote Partners to find out if the president’s long absence was in breach of the travel ordinance, the organisation shared a statement with this researcher affirming the president’s breach of the Government of Liberia’s revised travel ordinance of 2016/2017.The statement in part reads, “President Weah, who departed the country on November 1, 2022, violates these provisions. Additionally, there is no publicly available information on the number of people on this delegation and the total cost of funding this delegation for over 40 days. We call on the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning and the Presidency to be transparent on this matter. We caution President Weah against violating the laws he was elected to enforce and the oath he took to defend the constitution and provide stable leadership for Liberia.”Even more disturbing are reports suggesting that about nine Executive Protection Service (EPS) Agents have reportedly gone missing, having abandoned the Liberian President. But the EPS has since remained tight-lipped on the matter.Military takeovers and matters arisingWith the president and commander in Chief of the Liberia Armed Forces out of jurisdiction for a long time, there are questions about Liberia’s security and the risk of a military takeover.The fear of a military takeover was reinforced with a startling revelation by the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), Major General Prince Charles Johnson III.According to him, while President Weah was out of the country, several Liberians, both home and abroad, reached out to him through text messages and calls, encouraging him to take over the country as head of state through a military coup.General Prince Charles Johnson made the revelation on Tuesday, December 6, 2022, when he appeared in a telephone conversation on a local radio talk show, the Okay Afternoon Conversation, aired on Okay 99.5FMThe Liberian Army Chief of Staff’s assertions were made at 39:03-41:20 in an over two hours talk show. The show was carried live on the station's Facebook page and had over 200 comments, 3.7k views, and over 90 emojis.Despite his calls to take over, the Army Chief said his single most important commitment is to uphold the democratic dispensation led by President Weah and will not entertain any military takeover.To demonstrate his commitment to peace and democracy, the Army Chief warned that the military would deal ruthlessly with people who attempt to foment trouble and destabilise the country. He added protests and demonstrations not sanctioned by law would also be dealt with.Liberia’s coup history and ECC criticismSome Liberians, including civil society organisations in the country, have heavily criticised the posturing of the Army chief.The latest criticism came from the Elections Coordinating Center (ECC), Liberia’s largest domestic election observation network with diverse competencies, experiences and expertise in democracy, elections and governance established in 2010.According to the ECC statement under the signature of its chairman, Oscar Bloh, the ECC is deeply concerned about a public caveat issued by the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) regarding the rule of law.The ECC termed the Liberian Army Chief’s statement as completely out of order and a form of the military interfering in civil matters by instilling fear and intimidation in citizens.ConclusionFor the first time in recent Liberian history, the president left his jurisdiction for 48 days in what his spokespersons say is strictly for bilateral discussion and to improve the investment agenda. However, that drive has been questioned by opposition leaders and civil society organisations, some of whom have expressed fears of a military takeover.",26/12/2022,https://dubawa.org/explainer-tracking-the-law-on-presidential-travels-and-weahs-48-days-of-globe-trotting/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Misleading, inflation has not gone up in Liberia",Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: “Under President George Weah, the inflation rate has gone up,” a TV anchor in Nigeria asserts.Verdict: Misleading! Inflation has not gone up in Liberia.Full TextAs Liberia’s presidential and legislative elections draw closer, politicians have been campaigning vehemently to win the hearts and minds of citizens.These election campaigns are fought on issues, particularly corruption, security, cost of living etc.These issues are of great concern to the voters in previous elections as they are to them in the upcoming ones.In an era of a global crisis fueled by the worldwide pandemic, one of the most critical issues of concern to Liberian voters is the cost of living driven by the prices of goods and services.Over the last few days, there has been some controversy over whether or not inflation has gone up under the Weah administration. This debate was triggered by an interview with the immediate past Vice President of Liberia, now the standard bearer of the main opposition Unity Party (UP), Ambassador Joseph Nyumah Boakai, on a local news network in Nigeria, Arise News, during which he promised to rescue Liberia from its current leadership headed by President George Weah.During the interview, one of the hosts, Ayo Mairo-Ese, suggested to Ambassador Boakai that prices of goods (inflation rate) in Liberia have gone up under President George Weah. She, therefore, wanted to find out from the candidate what he would do about the rising cost of goods and services if he were voted into power.In response, Ambassador Boakai affirmed the host's suggestion and assured viewers of his commitment to deal with inflation if voted into power.The show was held on December 6, 2022, in Nigeria and was carried live on Arise News TV network with 7.5k viewers and hundreds of engagements.Madam Ayo Mairo-Ese made the claim at 13:40-50 seconds of the over 19 minutes show.Legitimate as the question may be, there has been controversy over whether inflation has gone up under the current administration.This has generated a lot of controversy in the social and traditional media, as seen here, with the author of the latter encouraging President Weah to ensure that his promises to fight inflation, corruption and other economic problems are fulfilled.DUBAWA, therefore, feels obligated to investigate whether or not inflation has gone up under President George Weah.VerificationTo ascertain the claim, it is important to understand what inflation is and to track the inflation rate before and during the tenure of President George Weah.Inflation is defined as a rise in the prices of goods and services across the economy, eroding purchasing power for consumers and businesses.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also has a similar definition which states: “inflation is the rate of increase in price over some time.”What was the inflation rate before President Weah was elected?To ascertain the claim, it is important to understand what inflation is and to track the inflation rate before and during the tenure of President George Weah.Inflation is defined as a rise in the prices of goods and services across the economy, eroding purchasing power for consumers and businesses.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also has a similar definition ""inflation is the rate of increase in price over some time.""What was the inflation rate before President Weah was elected?President Weah was voted into power in December 2017. Before his election, Liberia's inflation rate in 2016 was 8.83%. Data cited by DUBAWA indicate that Liberia's inflation rate rose to 12.42% in 2017, a 3.59% increase from 2016 and in 2018, 23.56%, a huge 11.14% increase from 2017. Since then, the rate of inflation has been drastically declining.According to the World Bank in Liberia, the September 30, 2022, latest report titled ""Liberia's poverty reduction strategy is supported by the rebuilding of core functions and institutions, rehabilitating infrastructure, and facilitating growth,"" under Economic overview, Liberia's inflation rate is put at 6.5% as of July 2022.According to the World Bank report, ""despite higher global fuel and food prices, inflation remained contained in 2021 and during the first half of 2022. Annual average inflation declined to 7.9% in 2021, down from 17.4% in 2020 and has moderated further to 6.5% in July 2022.""Also, per the latest report published by Aaron O'Neill on December 2, 2022, under the caption ""Inflation Rate in Liberia,"" the rate of inflation is 6.9%.ConclusionBased on the above, it is misleading to suggest that the inflation rate has gone up under the Weah-led administration. Data from reputable sources, including the World Bank, indicate that inflation increased only in the first year of his administration but has since taken a tumble to 6.5% in 2022, lower than the 8.3% it inherited.",23/12/2022,https://dubawa.org/misleading-inflation-has-not-gone-up-in-liberia/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Liberian Finance Minister’s affirmation of US$50 per bag of rice price in Sierra Leone cannot be substantiated,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: “The price of rice in Sierra Leone is US$50,”- Samuel TweahVerdict: No evidence to substantiate the assertion that a bag of rice is sold for US$50.Full textIn April of 1979, Former President William Tolbert increased the price of a 100-pound bag of rice from $22 to between $26 to $30, ignoring the fact that many Liberians at the time lived way below the poverty line in the country.The justification for Florence Chenoweth, then minister of agriculture, was for rice farmers to increase rice production instead of relying on imported rice. The increase in the price of rice urged Gabriel Baccus Matthews to form an opposition group called the Progressive Alliance of Liberia (PAL) to the government of Tolbert.Recently, the rice debate has taken centre stage in the country, following scarcity of the cereal leading to skyrocketing prices.On many occasions, Liberians were seen in long queues and even spending sleepless nights at various rice warehouses across the country in search of rice, the country’s staple food.As a result, President George Weah, in a statement, constituted a Rice Stabilization Taskforce to ensure the availability of the country’s staple food on the Liberian market.According to the statement published on the Liberia Executive mansion website, the Liberian leader named the Ministries of Agriculture, Finance and Development Planning, Commerce and Industry, State for Presidential Affairs, and Justice as part of the task force.The statement indicated, “the others are the Liberia Chamber of Commerce, Mayor Jefferson T. Koijee, Mayor, Monrovia City Corporation, National Port Authority, Mr Steve Flahn-Paye, Coordinator Japanese Counterpart Value Fund and Hon. Charles Bright, Economic Advisor to the President of the Republic of Liberia.”Appearing on a local radio show, “Spoon Talk”, aired on Spoon FM and TV, the Liberian Minister of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP), Samuel Tweah, claimed that the price of rice in neighbouring Sierra Leone is US$50.Minister Tweah asserted that Liberians should be grateful that the Weah-led government is keeping the price of rice down way below the price in Sierra Leone.In Minister Tweah's words, ""Ghanaians are protesting for Microeconomic reasons. The price of rice in Sierra Leone is fifty dollars, we've been keeping it down, and investors are calling and asking us why Liberia is doing better.""This show was carried on the institution’s live Facebook page with over 20k viewers, 11k comments, over 500 shares and 1k emojis.This claim is made at 1:33:1-25 seconds in the over four hours show aired on November 9, 2022.VerificationConsidering the importance of rice as a staple food in Liberia and consequently a political commodity in the country, DUBAWA embarked on a fact-finding mission to ascertain if the comment made by the Liberian Minister of Finance is true or false.We first decided to contact the Finance Minister, Samuel Tweah, to provide information on the type of rice and where precisely in Sierra Leone it was sold for $50, to enable us to verify the assertion, but he failed to respond, as seen here in the WhatsApp conversation.Through our correspondent in Sierra Leone, Fayia J Moseray, DUBAWA contacted local business people within the Sierra Leonean market who provided us with the price of the various types of rice in the market.Bella rice or Pusawa is being sold for 580les, equivalent to US$30 to 35.OAU is being sold for 550les, amounting to US$25 to 27.Fen Fen is also being sold for 550les amounting to $25 to 27.DUBAWA also spoke to some rice traders in Freetown who sell rice per bag to verify the assertion made by Samuel Tweah, Liberia's Finance Minister.One of the traders said some rice brands vary from 500 to 680 new leones. He noted that Pusawa rice is sold at 510,000 and 530,000 (510 & 530 Nles) for the big bag; OAU rice is sold at 500 & 510 leones; Bella-Bella rice is sold at 550 leones, and Jasmine rice is sold at 580 leones.DUBAWA visited another shop around Kroo Town Road in the Western part of Freetown. A trader told DUBAWA that the Fen-Fen rice is the most expensive rice, which is sold for 680,000 old leones (680 Nles), equivalent to some $32 to $35.Of all of these prices, none is equivalent to the $50 the minister mentioned as selling price for a bag of rice in Sierra Leone.Bags of Bella-bella riceConclusionFollowing the interaction with local business people in Sierra Leone over the price of rice, it is safe to conclude that the assertion by Liberia’s Finance Minister, Samuel Tweah, that a bag of rice is sold for US$50 in Sierra Leone cannot be substantiated. Per our investigation, the highest price a bag of rice in Sierra Leone is being sold is US$35.",17/11/2022,https://dubawa.org/liberian-finance-ministers-affirmation-of-us50-per-bag-of-rice-price-in-sierra-leone-cannot-be-substantiated/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

False! Weah never promised to implement war and economic crimes court at UNGA,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"President George Weah told the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2019 that he would have implemented the War and Economic Crimes Court upon his return.President Weah did not tell UNGA in 2019 that he would have implemented the war and economic crimes court for Liberia.Full textSince the end of the 14 years of civil unrest, Liberians at home and abroad have been calling for establishing of a war and economic crimes court to prosecute the country's perpetrators of war and financial crimes.The plea for justice is summed up in a story published in 2021.Even the now-ruling Coalition for Democratic Change led government, while in opposition, was the key champion for the country's war and economic crimes court.The party held a series of protests demanding that the then-ruling Unity Party (UP) establish the court, a call that did not materialise.After winning power, the party made a profound u-turn, as seen here.Also, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established by the TRC Act in 2005 to “promote national peace, security, unity and reconciliation.""It was also set-up to make it possible to hold perpetrators accountable for gross human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law that occurred in Liberia between January 1979 and October 2003.Since the end of the war, not a single Liberian has been prosecuted for their role in the war. Instead, some of the perpetrators are now being rewarded with top government positions such as senators and representatives, leaving their victims wallowing in economic deprivation.Appearing on a talk show, the Okay Conversation aired on Okay FM on Monday, October 24, 2022, the national youth chairman of the opposition ruling Unity Party, Melvin Cephas, stated that President George Weah told the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2019 that he would implement the War and Economic Crimes Court upon his return.Cephas further stated, “After telling the UNGA in 2019 that he would have implemented the war and economic crimes court, President Weah got back here and did nothing in that direction but only for him to return this year to tell some Liberians in the United States that Liberia looks like Miami.”The show, which was carried live on the station’s Facebook page, had about four hundred comments, over four thousand viewers and over one hundred and ninety emojis, and this statement is made at 2:23:1-18 secondsVerificationConsidering the importance of this claim and how sensitive it is for the people of Liberia, DUBAWA embarked on a fact-checking mission to investigate exactly what the Liberian leader told the UNGA in 2019.Through research, DUBAWA accessed the speech delivered by President George Weah at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2019 and found as follows; the nine-page statement covered a variety of issues including the global crisis, poverty eradication, and quality education.However, pages five to seven focused largely on the war crimes and how the Liberia people have dealt or intend to deal with it.“When I spoke before you last September, after my first 9 months in office, I indicated a preference for dialogue as a conflict-resolution mechanism, so that as a Government and People, we could together focus our efforts on poverty-reduction, growth, and economic development, rather than on retribution.“However, since that time, there has been a rising chorus of voices from many quarters calling for the establishment of an economic and war crimes court. These voices include thousands of war victims and some of the alleged perpetrators, who seem to wish to either clear their names or their conscience.“Support for the establishment of the court has also been voiced by many international organizations, as well as some of our international partners.“Mr. President, we are at a loss to understand why the clamor for the establishment of the court is now being made, almost a full decade after it was first called for, and during which time no such pressure was brought to bear on the government that grew out of the Accra Peace Accord,” the president stated.“Considering the importance of this matter, I have already begun consultations with our National Legislature – the representatives of our people - and we intend to have a broader engagement with the Liberia Judicial System and with our strategic International Partners and Organisations to determine pertinent issues such as legal framework, timing, venue, and funding, among others,” he added.DUBAWA read the speech delivered by the president at the UNGA and found no promise to implement a war and economic crimes court.DUBAWA also watched the entire address by President George Weah during the UNGA 2019 presentation to be sure that what was in the script was exactly what was read by the president. From 10:49-16:19 portion of the video, the Liberian leader spoke about ways to bring lasting peace and stability to Liberia, just as in the script.At no point did he promise to implement war and economic crimes court.ConclusionEven though President George Weah spoke about the adverse impact of war crimes on the people of Liberia during his UNGA speech, he did not promise to implement the war and economic crimes court for Liberia.",31/10/2022,https://dubawa.org/false-weah-never-promised-to-implement-war-and-economic-crimes-court-at-unga/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
False! President Weah did not win 78% of votes in 2017 election,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"‘I had 78% of the popular votes of the Liberian people’ - WeahAccording to the Liberian National Elections Commission (NEC) data in the 2017 Presidential election, candidate Weah won 61.54% of the votes during the run-off.Full textWith just a year to go for the next Liberian elections, parties and candidates have switched into campaign mood, promising to fulfil old pledges and make new ones.One such candidate is President George Weah.In a video that has already gone viral, George Weah is heard claiming to have won 78% of the popular votes of the Liberian people during the 2017 Presidential election in Liberia.The Liberian leader’s comment is contained in a viral video circulating on social media under a Facebook name Under The Palava Hut.He is addressing scores of Liberians at a programme.According to President Weah, he said: “I have a price here. We went to elections; remember, I had 78% of the popular votes of the Liberian people. Those with 1%, 1.5%, 0.6% etc, do not tell me anything that will discourage me from doing my work.”The statement is made at precisely 0:22 seconds to 0:50 seconds of the video.President Weah’s assertions are a direct jab at his critics within the opposition community, suggesting that candidates with such insignificant electoral votes do not have the mandate to direct him on what to do as president.He is convinced that his party has the overwhelming support of the population a few months before the 2023 Presidential and legislative elections in Liberia.VerificationDue to the virality of the claim and the controversy it has generated, DUBAWA embarked on a fact-check mission to ascertain the truth.On October 10, 2017, Liberians went to the polls to elect a new President to replace then Africa's first female President, Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, whose tenure had ended.According to the National Elections Commission (NEC) results in the first round of the 2017 elections, President George Weah of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) garnered 596,037 votes amounting to 38.37%. His rival, former Vice President, Ambassador Joseph N. Boakai of the then-ruling Unity Party (UP), came second with 446,716 votes constituting 28.76%.After a protracted legal battle over election fraud which eventually ended up at the Highest Court of Liberia, the Justice ordered a rerun of the election.Consequently, there was a run-off election between the two top candidates out of the 20 candidates who contested for the Liberian presidency.On December 26, 2017, Liberians again went to the polls to decide the winner between the two leading candidates and to give that winner the mandate to govern. It was at this round of the election, according to the National Election Commission (NEC), that the former soccer icon, now president of Liberia, secured a total of 732,185 votes accounting for 61.54%, while his contender received a total of 457,579 votes representing 38.46%, to enable George Weah become the President of Liberia.According to the International Foundation for Electoral System (IFES) data, George Weah won the Liberian 2017 Presidential election in the first round with 596,037 votes amounting to 38.37% and in the run-off, the West Africa Brief report indicated that President Weah won with 732,185 votes accounting for 61.54%.ConclusionBased on all of the data provided by the National Elections Commission (NEC) of Liberia on the 2017 Presidential and legislative elections, data from the International Foundation for Electoral System (IFES), and the West Africa Brief, it is evident that the assertion by the Liberian leader that he won 78% of the popular votes of the Liberian people is false. Rather, he obtained 38.37% during the first round and 61.54% during the second round.",20/10/2022,https://dubawa.org/false-president-weah-did-not-win-78-of-votes-in-2017-election/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
False! Public wage bill under former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was never 70% of total expenditure,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: Public sector wage bill size was increased to 70% of the country’s expenditure totalling $320 million under Johnson Sirleaf.False! The last employee compensation under former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was 59%, not 70% of expenditure. Data from the 2017 to 2018 budget statement and a report from USAID nullify the claim.Full TextA known supporter of the Weah-lead administration has said the erstwhile government under President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf left behind an unsustainable wage bill.According to Samuel Jackson, an Economist, the wage bill under the former administration ballooned to 70%, amounting to $320 million. He said this left the government with little or no space for capital investment, which was essential in building post-war Liberia.He made the claim during a debate with Amos Tweh, Secretary General of the immediate past administration, the Unity Party.The debate was held on a local radio station, Okay FM 99.5, and was carried live on the station’s Facebook page on September 19, 2022.The claim by Mr Jackson was made at two hours and five minutes of the almost three-hour show.According to Jackson, due to this huge wage bill inherited by the CDC-led government, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) requested the Weah-led government reduce the country’s wage bill. He said this led to the government harmonization plan during the first two years of the Weah administration.This action by the government led to a series of protests by some civil servants in the country.VerificationThe IMF defines the wage bill “as the total compensation, in cash or kind, payable to a government employee in return for work. It includes wages and salaries, allowances, and social security contributions made on behalf of employees to social insurance schemes (IMF, 2014b).”According to the IMF working paper titled: Fiscal Implications of Government Wage Bill Spending, the higher the wage bill, especially in developing countries, the greater the fiscal imbalances.With this in mind and the huge public interest this debate has generated, DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim made by Mr Jackson.During the research, DUBAWA discovered that the last approved national budget of the country under former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, 2017/2018 puts the size of the country’s wage bill at 59% of total expenditure, amounting to $298.020,404 million. This is found on page xiii (3) of the 2017/2018 approved national budget of Liberia.Again, page two of the USAID report: Process mapping study, pay and payroll reform in the government of Liberia also confirms that the wage bill for the 2017-18 financial year was 57% of the Government of Liberia’s total expenditure. This is found under the caption ‘Fiscal Conditions.’ConclusionFollowing an investigation into the claim, DUBAWA can conclude, based on official documents available, that Liberia’s wage bill in the final year of former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s administration was not 70%. It was 59%, according to the budget statement of 2017-18.",12/10/2022,https://dubawa.org/false-public-wage-bill-under-former-president-ellen-johnson-sirleaf-was-never-70-of-total-expenditure/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Explainer: The Global Magnitsky Act and Liberia’s 3 Corrupt Officials,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Corruption has always been one of Liberia’s biggest problems despite several promises by successive governments to fight it. Whether or not the Weah-led government is winning the war on corruption is still a matter of debate. But on August 15, 2022, the fight against corruption in Liberia suffered a massive kick in the teeth.Liberians were greeted with a report released by the US Treasury Department under the Global Magnitsky Act, sanctioning three top government officials of the Liberian government for corruption-related offences. According to the report, those affected are Nathaniel McGill, Liberia’s Minister of State for Presidential Affairs and chief of staff to President George Weah; Sayma Syrenius Cephus, current Solicitor General (SG) and chief prosecutor of Liberia and Bill Twehway, Managing Director of the National Port Authority (NPA).These officials, the report indicated, have been sanctioned pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13818. The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Act targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world.Following the sanction, the Liberian leader, George Weah, quickly moved to suspend the three top officials of his government, an action that still does not go down well with some Liberians and opposition members. They have since called for the immediate dismissal of the three officials from the government.Since the release of this report by the US Government through its Department of Treasury, it has sparked massive media discussion, both locally and internationally as can be seen here and here.Having followed the discussions on the matter and the huge controversy it has generated, DUBAWA decides to take a comprehensive look into the history of The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Act; how it has operated so far in the fight against global corruption; and how Liberia’s three top officials were caught in the web.State of Corruption in LiberiaAccording to a 2021 Center for Transparency and Accountability in Liberia’s report on corruption, a whopping 90% of Liberians think and believe that the country is extremely corrupt under the George Weah-led administration.This is a stark departure from the promise the president gave in his inaugural address in 2018 after being sworn in as President of Liberia.He noted, “As officials of Government, It is time to put the interest of our people above our own selfish interests. It is time to be honest with our people. Though corruption is a habit amongst our people, we must end it. We must pay civil servants a living wage so that corruption is not an excuse for taking what is not theirs. Those who do not refrain from enriching themselves at the expense of the people – the law will take its course. I say today that you will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.” But Liberians do not think the president is walking the talk on corruption. The damning Global Magnitsky Act report on the three Top Liberian government officials constitutes a reality check on the state of corruption in Liberia. Before we delve deeper into the identities of the three officials, an understanding of the Global Magnitsky Act is crucial.What is the Global Magnitsky Act Report?The Global Magnitsky Human Rights and Accountability Act was first enacted into law in December 2016 and gives authority to the President of the United States to impose economic sanctions against foreign individuals or entities engaging in human rights violations or corruption.It was named after the Ukrainian-born Russian tax expert, Sergei Magnitsky, who died in prison in 2009 after being arrested in an alleged case of tax evasion. Before his death, he was responsible for exposing corruption and misconduct by Russian government officials while representing client Hermitage Capital Management. His arrest in 2008 and subsequent death after eleven months in police custody generated international attention and triggered both official and unofficial inquiries into allegations of fraud, theft and human rights in Russia.The US government, in reaction to Magnitsky’s death, promulgated the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act in 2012, tailor-made for Russians suspected to have engaged in grievous human rights abuses. In December 2016, the Sergei Magnitsky Accountability Act was expanded beyond Russia to include global citizens found culpable for corruption and abuse of human rights. This amended law came under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.A December 3, 2021, Congressional Research Service (Page 2) indicates that the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act will expire on December 23, 2022, even though there are attempts by some members of Congress to pass new legislation that will make the ACT permanent or modify it.The UN Security Council and the Magnitsky ActFor years, the UN Security Council has used the sanctions regime as a vehicle to fight the abuse of human rights in countries across the world. It is the option adopted by the UN to avoid the use of force against countries that are found guilty. Since 1966, a total of 30 sanctions have been slapped on countries including Yemen, Libya, Iran, Yugoslavia, Sudan, etc, and the sanctions mostly include economic and trade sanctions, travel bans, financial and commodity restrictions as spelt out in the UN website.Unlike the Magnitsky Act, the UN system uses the sanctions committee made up of all 15 members of the Council and chaired by the president of the council to decide to sanction another country. However, “The Global Magnitsky Act provides the executive branch [US government] with standing, global authority to impose targeted sanctions against specific persons, including in countries with which the United States otherwise shares important bilateral relations,” the Congressional US Service has said.Interestingly, however, the Magnitsky Act shares a similar sanctions regime with other US sanctions regime such as the “Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Acts (SFOPS), Section 7031(c),on corruption and human rights abuse.” As spelt out in Page 16 of the Congressional report, the SFOPS deals with individuals believed to have been “involved in significant corruption … or a gross violation of human rights.”How widespread has the Magnitsky Act been used?From its inception in 2016 several other countries especially in Europe have adopted the Magnitsky Act approach in fighting corruption and human rights abuses across the world. As a result, over 243 individuals and entities from 28 countries have been sanctioned under the Magnitsky Act.Reactions to the Liberia ReportLiberia’s government officials have become the newest individuals to have been caught in the web of the Magnitsky Act.Shortly after the sanction report was released, United States Ambassador to Liberia, Michael McCarthy, through a media engagement, said that the sanctions are as a result of a rigorous inter-agency investigation conducted to determine that these three officials engaged in corrupt acts.So what did these officials do?Nathaniel McGill, the suspended Minister of State and Chief of Staff in the office of President George Weah, has been serving in the position since the CDC-led government assumed state power in 2018. He was also the Chairman of the ruling party prior to serving as Minister of state and Chief of Staff in the office of the President. Since the inception of the CDC-led government, McGill is noted for living an extravagant lifestyle, a life he never had prior to becoming Minister of State and Chief of Staff in the office of President George Weah.In July 2021, he buried his late mother in a luxurious manner by building a tomb well furnished with flat-screen television and a gold-polish casket. This action by McGill triggered a huge controversy, with critics singing songs of corruption.As if this was not enough, in May 2022, he also built an island and named it in honour of his wife, Vivian Innis McGill (VIM Island), located in Marshall City on the edge of Farmington River next to the comfortable Lebasa resort as her 36th birthday gift. When asked about the source of funds for the building, McGill claimed the funds were provided by his friends.Until his suspension, Sayma Syrenius Cephus was the Solicitor General and Chief Prosecutor of Liberia. According to the report, Cephus has developed close relationships with suspects of criminal investigations and has received bribes from individuals in exchange for having their cases dropped.Cephus, prior to entering national government, has been involved in a series of alleged corrupt practices in the country while serving as private counselor for his clients as reported by the Front Page Africa NewspaperUpon his nomination by President Weah in 2020, this paper detailed a barrage of corrupt practices by Cephus and provided reasons why the Liberian Senate should not have confirmed him as chief prosecutor of the country. Yet, he was still confirmed only to be designated by the Magnitsky report.Following his sanction and subsequent suspension, Cephus wrote to President Weah accusing the Minister of Justice, Cllr. Musa Dean of masterminding his name being placed on the sanction list by the US Treasury Department. Cephus alleged that Minister Dean wrote to the US Embassy in Monrovia accusing him of running a parallel Ministry of Justice, a claim the Minister of Justice, Cllr. Dean and US Ambassador in Monrovia have since refuted.The third official is Bill Twehway. He was Managing Director of the National Port Authority (NPA) and former Representative of Montserrado County District #3 in the Liberian LegislatureAccording to the report, “Twehway orchestrated the diversion of $1.5 million in vessel storage fee funds from the NPA into a private account. It further stated that Twehway secretly formed a private company through which he later unilaterally awarded a contract for loading and unloading cargo at the Port of Buchanan. The contract was awarded to the company less than a month after its founding. Twehway and others used family members to obfuscate their own involvement in the company while still benefiting financially from the company.” As a result of this, he was a subject of investigation by the Liberia Anti- Corruption Commission (LACC).After becoming head of the National Port Authority (NPA) of Liberia, Twehway turned into a philanthropist with a series of donations to the people of RiverCess County, his hometown. At some point, he provided about eighty bundles of zinc for the roofing of some homes within a town called Zeo town, River Cess County. Residents have since petitioned him to contest the senatorial seat in the impending legislative and presidential elections in the country.Liberia’s history of sanctionsThis is not the first time the US Treasury Department has sanctioned senior Liberian government officials for acts of corruption and other human rights crimes.Prior to the sanctioning of these three top officials, the US treasury Department sanctioned two lawmakers, Senators Varney Sherman and Prince Y. Johnson of Bomi and Nimba Counties respectively.Senator Prince Y. Johnson is a former warlord-turned-politician and has been representing one of the largest counties in the country, Nimba since 2005. He was also the chairman of the Liberian Senate Committee on National Defense, Security and Veteran affairs while representing Liberia at the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) parliament. Upon being placed on the sanction list, the US Embassy in Monrovia issued a statement saying that while the U.S. government is proud of its longstanding partnership with the Ministry of National Defense and Armed Forces of Liberia which will continue, they would have no relationship with Senator Johnson.The U.S. Embassy continues, “Senator Johnson’s gross human rights violations during Liberia’s civil wars are well-documented; his continued efforts to protect himself from accountability, enrich his own coffers and sow division are also well known. That the Liberian Senate would see fit to elevate him to a leadership role – particularly in the area in which he has done this country the most harm — creates doubts as to the seriousness of the Senate as a steward of Liberia’s defense and security.”For his part, Senator Varney Sherman, the current chairman of the Liberian Senate Committee on Judiciary, Claims and Petition, was also sanctioned by the US Treasury Department on allegations of corruption in Liberia.What are Liberians saying about the report as well as the Magnitsky Act?The Center for Transparency and Accountability (CENTAL), a civil society organization and national chapter of Transparency International (TI), which is the global coalition against corruption, is excited by the sanctions slapped on the three officials.In a strongly worded statement, CENTAL called on relevant Liberian Authorities to seek the support of U.S. Government to thoroughly investigate and prosecute the designated officialsWhile he applauds the Liberian government for the decision to suspend the three, the boss of CENTAL, Anderson Miamen, indicated that the government must go further by dismissing the three officials.In addition,the immediate past administration, the opposition Unity Party (UP), has criticised President Weah’s action to suspend the three government officials. He is demanding the immediate dismissal of the trio from his government.For his part, Presidential hopeful in the impending 2023 Presidential and Legislative elections in Liberia, Cllr. Taiwan Gongloe, has welcomed the action by the US government and noted the Liberian leader himself risks being sanctioned by the US.The former President of the Liberian National Bar Association (LNBA), Counselor Tiawan Gongloe, asserted that if President Weah refuses to dismiss his three sanctioned officials, he, Cllr Gongloe and others will campaign for the president to be blacklisted from going to the US.

Explainer: Liberia’s political jigsaw and the proliferation of violence?,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"What was meant to be a peaceful demonstration on Liberia’s 175th Independence Day celebration turned violent after a pro-government group, the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) Council of Patriots (COP), brutalized a student of the state-run campus based political party, The Vanguard Student Unification Party (SUP).The incident took place during the early hours of Tuesday, July 26, 2022, after the students decided to stage a protest before the United States Embassy in Monrovia. Among other things, the students asked the government to fix the country, a tagline that has become popular for many anti-government protesters.The violence is a drawback for the country’s fledgling democracy, something DUBAWA is concerned about and has taken interest in understanding vis-a-vis causes of the violence, the groups associated with it, and what can be done to avoid such violence in future.The Coalition and Patriots MarriageThe Coalition for Democratic Change Council of Patriots (CDC CoP) is a breakaway group from what used to be Council of Patriots, an anti-government organisation that was vehement in its opposition to the ruling government. Since breaking away and joining forces with the governing party, it has spared no effort in backing all government projects and activities.The violence witnessed on July 26 appears to be a by-product of this new political marriage in which the breakaway members of the Council Patriots underlined their unflinching allegiance to the Coalition of Democratic Change. In the process, some members of The Vanguard Student Unification Party (SUP) became victims of the violent attacks.Demonstration and political violenceThe members of Vanguard Student Unification Party (SUP) were angry over what they said was the rising cost of living in Liberia, rising state of insecurity, and a weak educational system.Food prices have soared owing largely to hikes in the price of gasoline which is now selling at US$5.66 (L$875) up from US$5.00 (L$750). As a result, transportation fares have increased, thus triggering agitations by some commercial drivers, bike and tricycle (Kehkeh) riders, and other citizens in the country.There have also been a series of deaths in the country, raising questions about insecurity. It is so serious the President, in a recent conversation, charged Liberians to install CCTV for their own protection. The Minister of State for Presidential Affairs, Nathaniel McGill, was also on record as saying that the government is considering making the installation of CCTV mandatory in the country, as reported by the government owned news outlet, The Liberia News Agency (LINA).These comments angered a section of the citizens, including members of the SUP. They were also not happy with the results of Liberian students in the WASSCE exams, even though the Weah administration shouldered the cost of taking the West African Senior School Certificate Examinations (WASSCE) for all senior students in the country.It is for these reasons and many others that the protestors hit the streets on July 26, first to the US Embassy in Liberia to hand over their petition.Why the US Embassy?Per Article 41 of the Vienna Convention, Heads of Missions have a duty not to interfere with the internal activities of a host country. However, in Liberia, the angry protesters say they had lost confidence in the Weah led administration so much that they did not even trust him to listen to their grievances. Rather, they believed the US Embassy could engage the Weah administration better, hence their decision to petition the US Embassy.On the day of the demonstration, the students who had earlier decided to converge on campus before making their way to the US Embassy in Monrovia changed their plan by moving straight to the Embassy.At the US Embassy, located at the top of Benson Street in central Monrovia, the students waved placards with inscriptions “fix the country” while chanting anti-government slogans. This did not go down well with the Coalition of Democratic Change Council of Patriots (CDC CoP), who embarked on a counter protest.Checks by DUBAWA indicate that as early as 6:00am that fateful Tuesday morning, the CDC-CoP, besieged the headquarters of the campus-based political party, SUP, on the Capitol Hill campus of the University of Liberia, hoping to find the students there. Seeing nobody, the CDC-CoP members moved to the US Embassy wearing white t-shirts with the words,“George Weah is fixing the country.There was chaos shortly after, with the pro-government supporters chasing and pelting the anti-government supporters with stones. This would later turn bloody with injuries to several students, one of them critical. The victim, Christopher Walter Sisulu Sivili, was brutalized in full glare of the camera. He was hospitalized in Liberia for some days but has since been flown out of the country to seek medical attention.This attack has received widespread condemnation by multiple stakeholders in Liberia.The Minister of Justice, Musa F Dean, has since condemned the violent acts. According to him, he did not receive any request from any group for a demonstration, as required by law. Per Liberia’s Public Order Law which is National Police Act 2015 Section III Article 22.86, persons who wish to embark on any form of demonstration must first petition the Minister of Justice.He has since directed the Inspector General of Police to launch an investigation into the attacks.Lawsuit against aggressors?Even before the IGP begins investigations into the matter, the Council of Patriots (CoP) has sworn to take legal action against the group that attacked the SUP.Joseph Vallai, COP Secretary GeneralThe Secretary General of the group, Joseph K. Vallai, disclosed that the organisation would institute a 1.5million lawsuit against the abusers of the victim, to ensure that he gets justice.“What happened on July 26 of this year was a complete crackdown on civil liberty and abuse of human rights in public square and this cannot be a CDC-CoP thing, because was an attack on post war Liberia’s democracy,” he noted.Explaining why some members broke away from the group, Mr Vallai stated the aggrieved persons were suspended for acts of insubordination for which reason they decided to join the governing party.He said the Council of Patriots was established to hold the Weah administration accountable to the people and will need committed members to do that.Since its formation in 2019, the group has had a series of protests in the country including the famous June 7, 2019 protest which was under the theme: “Save the State.” It is regarded as Liberia’s biggest post war protest.Student Unification Party (SUP)Members of the SUPDUBAWA contacted the General Secretary of the Student Unification Party (SUP), Jusu Kamara to find out his thoughts about the demonstration and the attacks.“We were calling on the George Weah administration to fix the educational sector of this country and the kangaroo justice system. We were also calling on him to act on the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC) reports which fingered several government officials and institutions, including the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC) the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and the Liberia Institute for Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) for acts of corruption,” he stated.Kamara condemned the attack on the students during their demonstration. Meanwhile, the campus-based political party has vowed to come out in their numbers to stage another protest until the George Weah led government listens to their calls.Coalition of Democratic Change (CDC) Council of Patriots (CoP)On their part though, members of the Coalition for Democratic Change have dismissed the allegations of violence against them. According to the group’s chairman, Ben Believe Togbah Jnr, they did not organise any violent protest as was reported. Speaking on OKAY FM, which was transmitted live on the station’s official Facebook Page, Mr Togbah Jnr denied accusations of counter demonstration and violent attacks on the SUP.Members of the CDC-CoPAccording to him, they had gone to show gratitude to President Weah for the many developmental initiatives undertaken since becoming president but encountered hostile members of the Student Unification Party (SUP), some of whom were throwing rocks and wielding deadly weapons, an allegation DUBAWA cannot independently verify.What Civil Society Thinks About Demonstrations?The Executive Director of the Center For Media Studies & Peace Building (CEMESP) Malcolm W. Joseph, has condemned the violent demonstrations. He told DUBAWA that Article 17 of the Liberian constitution clearly spells out the right for every Liberian to freely assemble at all times but in an orderly manner.He is convinced that notifying the government before a demonstration is necessary to ensure the safety of the demonstrators but was quick to throw in a word of caution.“Notifying the government does not mean that the government will have to be selective in who demonstrates or who doesn’t. Sometimes when the government of the day realizes that those who want to protest or demonstrate are critical of the government, the government may not want to grant them the permission to do so,” he stated",07/09/2022,https://dubawa.org/explainer-liberias-political-jigsaw-and-the-proliferation-of-violence/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Central Bank of Liberia has not minted coins in L$25 and L$30 denominations,Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: “The government through the Central Bank of (CBL) has minted coins in the L$25 and L$30 denominations” according to a Facebook user.The Central Bank of Liberia says it is only minting coins in L$5 and L$10 denominations.Full TextIt seems that Liberia is returning to the pre-war era where Liberians used coins for business transactions and as legal tender. In 1847 and 1862, copper 1 and 2 cents coins were issued and were the only Liberian coins until 1896, when a full coinage consisting of 1, 2, 10, 25 and 50 cents coins were introduced. The last issues were made in 1906.In accordance with Article 34(d) of the Liberian constitution, the Liberian legislature mandated the Central Bank of Liberia to print new currency and mint coins in the country.Article 34(d) states that the legislature shall have the power, among other things, “to levy taxes, duties, imports, exercise and other revenues, to borrow money, issue currency, mint coins, and to make appropriations for the fiscal governance of the Republic.”It is upon this reliance, the Liberian legislature, on May 6, 2021, signed and issued a joint resolution (Resolution #001/2021) authorizing the Central Bank of Liberia to print and mint the new family of Liberian currency to the tone of L$48 billionThe legislature’s decision was informed by the Counsel from the Economic Management Team (EMT) of the country falling shortages of Liberian dollar notes on the market. There is also a huge quantity of mutilated banknotes and the scarcity of smaller denominations like L$5, L$10 and L$20 Liberian banknotes on the market.This new currency is expected to be printed and minted within a three-year period beginning in 2021, 2022 and 2024. The year 2023 was skipped because, according to the legislature, it is the election year.There have been occasions where taxi drivers, tricycles (kehkeh), and motorbike riders and passengers get into confrontations over lack of change or when there is disagreement over mutilated currency as change or transport fares.It is to solve these challenges that the Liberia Legislature in March of 2021, granted authorization to the CBL for the printing and minting of new family of Liberian currency.Following the authorization, the CBL, in December of 2021 printed and brought into the country the first consignment of newly printed Liberian dollar banknotes so as to help ease the problems during the festive season CBL.Despite the coming of the first batch of the newly printed Liberian dollars in the country, the problem of shortages of smaller denominations and mutilated money still persisted because the CBL had only printed notes in higher denominations, including one hundred Liberian dollars here CBL.Despite the chronology of the events, there has been news of the arrival of the new family of banknotes and minted coins in the country with some Liberians taking to their social media (Facebook) pages with claims of what they believe is the image of the newly minted coins.Facebook page of Strong GbanaAmong the many posts on social media (Facebook) was Liberia’s famous social media giant based in Canada, Varney A Teah who goes by the Facebook name “Strong Gbana Pekin.”This post by Strong Gbana Pekin generated over 250 comments, 13 shares and over 270 emojis.Here are some comments under this post:Diophine Kimirah GoodridgeComments on Strong Gbana’s postComments on Strong Gbana’s postVerificationDue to the seriousness of the currency situation in the country, DUBAWA embarked on an investigative venture to ascertain the facts surrounding the various posts flooding social media (Facebook) in recent times as can be seen here and here.DUBAWA first decided to look at the authorization granted the CBL to print banknotes and mint coins, by the Liberian Legislature “Resolution #001/2021” and resolution is found on page 18 and 19 of the CBL annual report 2021.DUBAWA went further by contacting one of the officials at the CBL Atty. Alphonso Zeon to provide explanation for the various claims on Facebook about the new 30 Liberian dollars and 25 Liberian dollars minted coins.Mr. Alponson Zeon insisted there were no 30 or 25 Liberian dollar minted coins as can be seen in the WhatsApp conversation below.DUBAWA also contacted the Head of Communication at the CBL, Mr. Cyrus Wleh Badio, who told us that the various claims on Facebook are false.Mr. Cyrus Wleh Badio indicated that the news trending on Facebook about the bank minting 25 and 30 Liberian dollars coins are fabricated and far from the truth as can be seen again in the WhatsApp conversation below.A release has, however, been issued by the Ministry of Information Cultural Affairs & Tourism (MICAT) clarifying the numerous Facebook posts.This statement was also published on the government run media outlet, The New Liber Newspaper as well as on Liberia Ministry of Information Facebook page.ConclusionInvestigation by DUBAWA into social media (Facebook) posts suggests that speculations that the CBL has minted L$25 and L$30 coins are false. The CBL has clarified that it has only minted L$5 and L$10 in coins contrary to the many Facebook posts.",21/08/2022,https://dubawa.org/the-central-bank-of-liberia-has-not-minted-coins-in-l25-and-l30-denominations/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dual citizens cannot be elected as Representatives, Senators despite new law",Jackson C. Clay Jr.,"Claim: Persons with Dual Citizenship under the new dual citizenship law of Liberia are allowed to contest for Representatives and Senators.Nowhere in the new law does it allow dual citizens to be elected as Representatives, Senators.Full TextLiberia was founded by freed US slaves in 1847 as ""a refuge and a haven for freed men of colour”. Its constitution defines black people in the language of the time, as “persons who are Negroes or of Negro descent”.For years, the issue of dual citizenship in Liberia has been a very critical topic in the country since its post-war era. This is so because, during the country’s over fourteen years of civil unrest, many Liberians fled the country for safety in other countries, particularly in Europe and the Americas and took up those countries' citizenship for diverse reasons.The old alien and Nationality law states “A child who is a Liberia citizen by virtue of the provisions of subparagraph (b) of this section shall lose his citizenship unless he has resided in Liberia before attaining his majority or unless when he attains his majority and before attaining the age of 23 he goes before a Liberian consul and takes the oath of allegiance to the Republic of Liberia required of a petitioner for naturalization.”This law states further “(a) A person who is a Negro, or of Negro descent, born in Liberia and subject to the jurisdiction thereof. (b) A person born outside Liberia whose father (i) was born a citizen of Liberia; (ii) was a citizen of Liberia at the time of the birth of such child, and (iii) had resided in Liberia prior to the birth of such child.”Upon taking over as President of Liberia in 2018, President George Manneh Weah asserted during his first State of the Nation Address (SONA) that the Liberian constitution was racist, unnecessary and inappropriate and promised to scrap the law that prohibits foreigners from becoming citizens of the country.His position was further strengthened by a landmark case in 2019 when the Liberian Supreme Court ruled that citizenship is a right that could not be revoked without a trial. However, it is believed that some Liberians, especially the privileged, secretly carry dual passports.Notwithstanding how crucial this case was, it did not automatically grant Liberians a right to be dual citizens.There was a continued push for the new law on dual citizens with Liberians in the diaspora playing a huge role. After years of controversy including a referendum to reject the Dual Citizens law in December 2020, the country has finally agreed to a new Dual Citizens law passed in 2022.There is, however, some simmering controversy over the rights to be accorded the dual citizens of Liberia.During a radio talk show aired on a local radio station, Okay 99.5FM, Wednesday, August 10, 2022, Montserrado County District #16 Representative Dixon Seboe claimed that under the new amended alien and nationality law of Liberia, persons with dual citizenship are allowed to contest for Representatives and senators but cannot be speaker of the House of Representatives and President Pro-Tempore of the Liberian Senate.The claim was made in the 14 minute of the show and was carried live on the station’s Facebook page with over two thousand viewers andmore than one hundred and fifty comments. This show is one of the most widely listened to shows in the country.VerificationGiven how controversial this case has been over decades and the premium attention it has garnered owing to the amendment of the law, DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim made by Representative Dixon Seboe.This Fact Checker combed through the provisions of the old law which the amendment sought to change. The old laws include Part III, Chapter 20, Section 20.1; Chapter 21, Sections 21.30, 21.31, 21.51 & 21.52 and Chapter 22, Sections 22.1, 22.1 & 22.4 of the Aliens and Nationality Law of the Liberian Code of Law Revised, Vol. II.DUBAWA then went further to look at the new amendment passed by Parliament to ascertain if the claim by the Representative was true.Part of the new amendment can be accessed in this news report with the relevant portions of the new law quoted as follows;“A Liberian citizen who holds citizenship for another country shall not be eligible for any elective public office while still a citizen of another country,” the legislature said in the repeal of the Aliens and Nationality Law.“If such a person desires to contest, the person must renounce the citizenship of the other country at least one year before applying to the National Elections Commission (NEC) to contest with documentary evidence of such renunciation from the country and filed with a circuit court in Liberia.”“Also, a Liberian citizen who holds the citizenship of another country must not be eligible for appointment to the public offices of Minister of Finance and Development Planning; Minister of Defense, and Executive Governor of the Central Bank of Liberia.”As can be seen, the amended law prohibits those with dual citizenship from occupying an elected office and from becoming Minister of Defense, Governor of the Central Bank of Liberia and Minister of Finance in the country.The new law has received massive media reviews and reportage as can be seen here and here.ConclusionChecks by DUBAWA into the amended law do not support the claim made by Representative Dixon Seboe. While the amended law grants Liberians power to hold dual citizenship it does not allow dual citizens to occupy elected office and other sensitive positions.",16/08/2022,https://dubawa.org/dual-citizens-cannot-be-elected-as-representatives-senators-despite-new-law/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IFCN launches legal support fund for fact-checkers facing harassment,Alie Tarawally,"The International Fact-checking Network(IFCN) has announced the launch of the maiden Legal Support Fund to make financial support available to fact-checking organisations that are faced with threats of harassment, intimidation, and litigation.The fund was announced at the recently concluded Global Fact 9.The fund is a product of Meta’s renewed support and Google News Initiative’s year-long partnership with the International Fact-Checking Network.This year's Global Fact 9 conference has a gathering of fact-checkers from over 85 different countries around the world at the Oslo Metropolitan University in Oslo, Norway.Key among issues discussed are the challenges faced by fact-checkers in their respective regions of the world and the increasing level of hostility towards their work.These challenges are mission critical for fact-checking organizations and for the practice of accountability journalism at large. The fund is, therefore, positioned to shield fact-checkers from these hostilities.The discussion, which was part of the ninth annual GlobalFact hosted by IFCN, was moderated by IFCN director Baybars ?rsek and featured a panel of representatives from Meta.“Fact-checkers around the world are experiencing harassment and online abuse in different forms and capacities. We are excited to offer a sense of support to organizations facing those challenges on the ground and working toward finding sustainable solutions to navigate increasing attacks on journalism and fact-checking with significant support from Meta and Google News Initiative,” Mr. ?rsek said.He added, “We’re thrilled to partner with IFCN on this crucial initiative to protect fact-checkers from harassment and provide the financial support they need to address the unique challenges they face,” said Karishma Shah, News Integrity Program Manager at Meta. “The Legal Support Fund is a critical part of our ongoing effort to support fact-checkers and connect them with resources to mitigate the risks they face as they work to debunk viral misinformation.”The sum of 40,000 US dollars have been made available for each eligible applicant and the fund is directed towards empowering fact-checking organizations to hire a media defense lawyer. The role of the attorney hired will be to provide legal representation in matters of disputes associated with fact-checking or reporting cases of defamation, copyright infringement, fair use and licensing.The Head of Google News Lab at Google News Initiative Matt Cooke revealed that “It is proving more important than ever for people to access accurate information, and sort facts from fiction in their everyday lives. As part of our ongoing support at the Google News Initiative, we’re hoping this partnership with the IFCN will scale their efforts to a worldwide audience.”The funds from Legal Support Fund will be administered by the IFCN and all intending applicants must be signatories to the IFCN’s Code of Principles. While fact-checking organizations are expected to apply to stand the chance of securing the grant, a committee comprising regional and global organizations with legal, journalism, and freedom of press domain expertise will lead the process of selecting grantees. The Committee members will carefully review each application for risks that can cause imprisonment, bankruptcy, and closure.Applications for the Legal Support Fund will open next month.

The Law that Changed Liberia’s Ugly handling of Speech Offense: Kamara Abdullah Kamara Act of Press Freedom Explained,Wremongar Joe,"Liberia's 1986 constitution provides for freedoms of speech and the press, but these rights are often restricted in actual practice.I have seen journalists sued and locked up behind the rusty bars of Monrovia’s South Beach Prison for either libel, sedition, or criminal malevolence.In July 2012, former Ellen Johnson Sirleaf became the second African head of state to endorse the Declaration of Table Mountain which calls on African governments to abolish criminal defamation laws.The Press Union of Liberia (PUL) had pressured the Sirleaf Administration in submitting a draft bill to the Legislature later that year that would move forward with the proposed decriminalization. A similar draft was submitted by the PUL and other media groups in December 2014.However, no action was taken on the bill as of the end of 2014, partly because Liberia's libel laws allow for large financial awards in civil suits, which can cause severe economic difficulties for journalists and media outlets, thus increasing the temptation to foster self-censorship.Although no major lawsuits were filed in 2014, suits filed against media houses in 2012 and 2013 sought more than $20 million in total damages, according to the PUL.President George Manneh Weah on May 31, 2018 resubmitted the bill to the National Legislature with modifications, to repeal some sections of the Penal Law of Liberia in an effort to decriminalize free speech in order to create an “unfettered media environment.”What the Kamara Abdullah Kamara Act of Press Freedom says?Upon seizing power in a bloody coup on April 12, 1980, the People Redemption Council’s Military junta of Samuel K. Doe issued a decree that made speech offenses criminal in Chapter 11 of the Penal Law of 1978.So, the KAK Act of Press Freedom repeals Chapter 11 of Penal Law of 1978, specifically, Sections 11.11 which border on criminal libel against the President; 11.12 on Sedition and 11.14 on criminal malevolence.This means that with the passage of this new law, criminal libel against the President, sedition, and criminal malevolence are outlawed if they were committed against public officials.With the law, media offenses will now be treated as civil offenses throughout the courts of Liberia.Why was the law named ‘Kamara Abdullah Kamara Act of Press Freedom?’The law is named after the deceased President of the Press Union of Liberia, Kamara Abdullah Kamara, due to his efforts in “strengthening and actualizing Liberia’s commitment to several legal instruments signed onto, such as Freedom of Information Act, the Table Mountain Declaration, and many others,” according to President George Weah.Kamara was one of Liberia’s most experienced media executives with a demonstrated history of working in the information services industry.He was skilled in nonprofit organizations, conflict, politics, policy analysis, and program evaluation and strong professional business. He had a bachelor of arts degree in Mass Communication from the University of Liberia.Affectionately called ‘KAK’ by many of his peers, Kamara died in the central Liberian city of Gbarnga, on Tuesday, April 17, 2018 hours after he was found “unconscious” in his hotel room.",28/09/2021,https://dubawa.org/the-law-that-changed-liberias-ugly-handling-of-speech-offense-kamara-abdullah-kamara-act-of-press-freedom-explained/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scam! Glo is not giving out 20GB data to Customers as 18th Anniversary Celebration Gifts!,Laymah Kollie,"Claim: A WhatsApp message claims that Globacom Limited (GLO) is giving out 20GB of data valid for 30 days without any recharge to all its customers in celebration of its 18th anniversary.The company has confirmed that the claim is not from them. GLO actually offered its prepaid customers in Nigeria N200 airtime (six minutes of talk time) and 200MB of data from 27th to 29th of August to mark its 18th anniversary celebration. Customers were not required to follow the procedures provided in the viral WhatsApp message.Full TextA random WhatsApp message purported to be from Globacom Limited (GLO), a Nigerian multinational telecommunication company, offering its customers 20GB of data valid for 30 days  in celebration of its 18th anniversary has been widely shared by users since 3rd of August..Screenshot of the claim.The claim, which requires sharing to many groups as means of getting the 20GB data, has been circulating on WhatsApp as many strive to get their share of the offer.VerificationIn verifying this claim, our fact-checker contacted GLO through its official Facebook account and it urged that the information be disregarded as it is not from them.Furthermore, we found that the original Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of GLO is www.glo.com and not https:bit.ly/MTN-FREE-10GB-DATA as indicated by the claim.GLO had indeed announced a reward of data and airtime packages to its subscribers in Nigeria in August to mark its 18th anniversary. Eligible customers must have recharged with a cumulative of N200 or above from July to August 16 and they would have received the offer as a message on their mobile phones without going through any process. Liberia was not mentioned in the announcement.Our fact-checker’s experienceOur fact-checker went further to verify the link attached to the message. When she clicked on the link, it opened with the GLO logo at the top and a message instructing the next step of the procedure with many comments of people believed to be participants of the process lauding the company for giving them the 20GB data.The next step requested participants to enter a mobile number and select the network provider. She entered a generated Lonestar number and selected MTN as the provider and clicked the send option. After a few minutes of loading, a congratulatory message popped up on the screen stating that the number was eligible for the offer. It instructed that the message be shared with 12 different WhatsApp groups in order to get to the final stage in getting the 20GB claimed. It also stated that when the task is fully completed, the participant will receive the offer within five minutes on her mobile phone.. Screenshot of the message belowAfter sharing to several groups, the chance of getting to the next stage grew slowly and requested a restart of the process. After some minutes of continued efforts to get to the next stage, she experienced some difficulty in logging into her Facebook account that led to non-access for some hours. She later got a warning from Facebook that she tried sharing intimate content that is against its regulations. It warned that if it is repeated her account will be blocked.Further verification through DomainBigData, an online investigative tool, shows that the website has been reported several times for abuse .ConclusionGLO is not offering 20GB to customers for 30 days as claimed by the viral message.

Did 82% of Liberians Agree to Transitional Justice?,Bettie Kemah Johnson-Mbayo,"Claim: “82.2% of the Liberian population opted for transitional justice or the Palaver Hut discussion to settle issues surrounding our civil war” - Syrenius Cephus, Solicitor GeneralThere is no evidence that 82.2% per cent of the Liberian population opted for Transitional justice or the Palaver hut discussion to settle issues surrounding our civil war.Full TextWhen Solicitor General (SG) Cephus appeared on OK FM, on August 2, 2021, he claimed that “82.2 per cent of the Liberian population opted for transitional justice or the palaver hut discussion to settle issues surrounding our civil war.”Cllr Cephus in an interview said his source was the TRC report.“You have to read the report, it is stated there, my reliance is the TRC,” he said.In Liberia, there have been calls from both local and international countries for the establishment of a war crimes court to bring justice to those bearing higher responsibility for Liberia’s more than a decade-long bloody civil war.But the SG says 82.2% of Liberians agreed to transitional justice instead of a war crimes court.Councilor Cephus also claimed that in the absence of what he calls total stability, the government would not opt for the establishment of such a tribunal.Liberia went through civil crises which resulted in the destruction of lives and properties, including the loss of approximately 250,000 lives and the displacement of thousands of Liberians, when a crisis engulfed the country in 1989.VerificationThis researcher perused the Truth Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report which the SG said he relied on and found that although there were palava huts on transitional justice forums, there was no mention of the percentage of Liberians who opted for it.Fubbi Henries, a War Crimes Court activist, also says there has been no survey conducted in Liberia to ascertain the total number of people who preferred transitional justice.“The claim is a lie,” he said in reaction to the claim.At the same time, Tennen Dalieh, a doctoral student at Dublin City University researching universal jurisdiction, transitional justice, peacebuilding and reconciliation in Liberia, said in an interview that there is no record of 82 per cent of Liberians consenting to transitional justice.“There is absolutely no record that 82 per cent agreed to transitional justice,” Dalieh said.BackgroundThe Senate endorsed the recommendation of its leadership committee to set up a Transitional Justice Commission (TJC).The plenary action of TJC came as a response to the request of President George Weah for advice on how his administration should proceed in handling the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).The unanimous decision was taken by the senate after expert opinions and inputs were solicited from the Solicitor General of Liberia, Saymah Syrenius Cephus, the Liberian National Bar Association and other interested parties.The TJC is to analyze the TRC report and give further recommendations to the President.ConclusionThere is no evidence that 82.2% of the Liberian population opted for transitional justice or the palaver hut discussion to settle issues surrounding Liberia’s civil war. According to the TRC report, though there were town hall meetings, there is no record that 82% of Liberians opted for transitional justice.",10/09/2021,https://dubawa.org/did-82-of-liberians-agree-to-transitional-justice/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yekeh Kolubah is throwing insults at his opponents.This account is a satire page; the account owner has confirmed that it is meant for fun and memes. It does not have the background knowledge.Full TextA fake Facebook account is currently using the particulars of the District number 10 (District#10) lawmaker of Montserrado County, Liberia, to throw insults and memes. Named Yekeh Kolubah, the account has been throwing indirect insults at the female representative aspirant, Karishma Pelham Raad, who has vowed to unseat Yekeh Kolubah in the 2023 National Elections in the Country.On August 23,2021, this account posted “I know nothing is impossible but a hoppojoe can never unseat me in district#10”.

The page user made it known that the lawmaker is not aware of the account and that he has no connection with him. Here's a screenshot of the conversation.To further verify the account, we checked out the profile of the account and it states that it is “JUST FOR FUN.”Our fact-checker also contacted Hon.

Monrovia- A 10 years old girl successfully delivered a bouncing baby girl 2.5kg in a local hospital located in Lofa county today.”VerificationWhen contacted, the county health officer of Lofa County, Dr. John S. Doedeh, said the claim is untrue.“Information about the 10-year old girl giving birth at a hospital in Lofa is absolutely not true,” Dr. Doedeh said in a text message.Speaking via phone, the administrator of the biggest government referral hospital in Lofa County, the Tellewoyon Memorial Hospital, Albert Cooler, said they have not received such cases at the hospital.“Though there are minors who give birth, however, a 10-year old girl giving birth at the hospital is false.”Also a health practitioner who works with the reproductive and maternal mortality unit at the Ministry of Health in Liberia, madam Younger Mulbah Pewee stated that there is no such case that involves a 10-year old girl giving birth at any of the hospitals in the country.In an effort to further verify the facts, our research showed that the incident occurred on August 4, 2019 and that the 10-year old girl actually gave birth to a girl child.It also unveiled that the story was published on August 7, 2019 by a Nigerian Organization based in Abuja, the Premium Times , which revealed that the 10-year old girl was allegedly raped in Benue State, Nigeria by an 18-year old man named Terna Tega who got her pregnant.A media company in Abuja, Daily Trust, published the story in 2019, quoting an activist, Ukan Kurugh, who through his advocacy was able to transfer the minor from the Foundation Hospital in Makurdi.Ukan Kurugh is quoted as saying “the girl was given a Caesarean section to deliver a baby girl weighing 2.5kg.Pulseng.com also published the story in August 2019.The story was also posted in 2019 on Twitter by other social media outlets.ConclusionFrom our research, the incident circulating on social media of a 10-year old giving birth to a girl child occurred in Nigeria in 2019 and not in Lofa County, Liberia as claimed by Facebook posts.",19/08/2021,https://dubawa.org/false-photo-of-a-10-year-old-girl-giving-birth-to-a-girl-child-did-not-happen-in-lofa-county-liberia/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FALSE! University of Western Australia Not Offering ‘SCHOLARSHIP’ As Claimed in Viral Whatsapp Message,Wremongar Joe,"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims Australian authorities are offering fully funded scholarships for international students at the University of Western Australia.The link in the WhatsApp message does not lead to the official website of the University of Western Australia but to one which requires users to provide some personal details and also to make some payments for visa.Full TextA viral post on WhatsApp claims that the Australian Government is giving out fully funded scholarships to international students to study at the University of Western Australia.As usually done by many online fraudsters, the message moving across WhatsApp is a forward-as-received message that attempts to direct readers to a websitewith an URL that says it belongs to University of Western Australia.The content contained in the WhatsApp message reads: “AUSTRALIA SCHOLARSHIP 202I, STUDY IN University of Western Australia FULLY FUNDED SCHOLARSHIP FREE”.It says the scholarship will cover full tuition fees, accommodation, medical facilities, traveling, and stationary allowances of successful students.The WhatsApp message ends with the instruction to apply via the link, https://bit.ly/Australia-scholarship-2021Screenshot of WhatsApp messageVerificationThe URL in the WhatsApp message directs users to a page where they are asked to provide personal details like names, email, country of origin among others.The next option allows them to apply and when that is clicked, another page displays “congratulations” in bold.Here, they are further sent to another page where they are requested to share the link with people on WhatsApp and are also requested to make payment for a visa in order to enter Australia for studies.Dubawa also found out that the site has an addition of a ‘Secure Sockets Layer’ (SSL certificate) which enables it to carry https://bit.ly/ to convince users that it is credible.Does a SSL Certificate mean a website is safe to use?The answer is a definite no.According to Web Titan, the HTTPS or a SSL certificate alone is not a guarantee that the website is secure and can be trusted.Many people believe that an SSL Certificate means a website is safe to use. Just because a website has a certificate or starts with HTTPS does not guarantee that it is 100% secure and free from malicious intent. It just means that the website isprobablysafe. In the vast majority of cases, the sites may be.A check of the website shows that the Uniform Resource Locator URL, which shows the address of a given resource on the worldwide web, does not have the .gov.au domain which is used by most Australian government websites.It only has bit.ly/Australia-scholarship-2021 domain that raises suspicion.Further checks on the website domain shows that the “ly” is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Libya.In 2011, the bit.ly address was set to redirect to bitly.com. The .ly top level domain, TLD is controlled by the Libyan government, which has previously removed one domain deemed incompatible with Muslim law, and not the Australian Government or the University of Western Australia.According to Macaria.com Network, to register a website in Australia, one will have to “enter the "".COM.AU"" and/or "".NET.AU""domain name(s) assigned to the country and not bit.ly.Response from the University of Western AustraliaThe University of Western Australia official website is https://www.uwa.edu.au/home. It has no information about fully funded foreign scholarships as purported in the WhatsApp message.WhatsApp message website of Australian University (L) and Real Website (R)Furthermore, the Australian Government’s information for international scholarships are posted on this website. If you check carefully, you will observe that the web address contains .gov.au and Australian-education/scholarship as opposed to the one in the viral WhatsApp message.ConclusionEven though the website contains an SSL certificate, research and analysis of the site show it is not authentic.Note: The researcher produced this fact-check per the 2021 Kwame Karikari Fact-checking Fellowship in partnership withCenter for Media Studies and Peacebuilding to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",10/08/2021,https://dubawa.org/false-university-of-western-australia-not-offering-scholarship-as-claimed-in-viral-whatsapp-message/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liberia’s Freedom of Information Law explained,Wremongar Joe,"Liberia's Freedom of Information (FOI) Act was signed into law on September 16, 2010. It grants everyone the right to access public records and information.The law fulfills provisions guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, as well as the Liberian constitution, to have access to public information.This article is not a comprehensive explanation of the FOI legislation, but aims to assist readers in understanding the advantages of the law to everyone. Please keep in mind that this publication is based on the Freedom of Information Act, the Carter Center's citizen guide to FOI legislation, and frequently asked questions.What kind of information can I request?Any kind of information may be requested, whether it is in written, printed, audio, visual, or electronic form.Specifically, this includes any document that has been created, received, utilized, controlled, and/or held by any government agency or private organization that distributes or receives public money. They include details regarding an agency's operations, such as its activities, budgets, and expenditures - how much money was received, spent, and on what - agency policies and decisions, as well as the rationale and explanation for the decision, statistical data, administrative staff manuals laws, rules, and regulations legislation and regulations.How can I learn where to obtain information?The FOI legislation requires all public authorities to develop and maintain a user-friendly and publicly available “publication scheme” that contains comprehensive information about their basic duties, the nature of their activities and operations, and the kinds of documents/information they possess.More specifically, the publication scheme should include:Contact information for the authority's information officer;A clear description of the agency's organization, function, and powers, as well as an explanation of how it makes decisions and discloses information;The location and types of categories of documents and information that the agency holds;And procedures for accessing documents or information.If you are unsure which authority has the information you want, you may consult the publishing scheme, contact the information officer at the agency you believe holds the information, or simply submit your request with the agency. If you submitted your request in the incorrect location, the agency is obliged to transfer it to the right agency. The information officer is responsible for assisting you in submitting requests and receiving information.Can I obtain information without needing to file a request?According to the legislation, some information must be made accessible to the public without the need to make a request for information, according to the legislation. Information that is made accessible without the need for a request is termed “automatically published” or “proactively disclosed,” information, and public bodies are obliged to make this information available through a website or physical publication. The types of documents subject to automatic publication include legislation, existing policies, procedures and rules, and budgets.How can I file a request for information?You may submit a request for information in writing via electronic mail, verbally, or by any other means permitted by law. However, the request should be detailed enough to allow the public agency or private organization to readily identify the material you want. If this is not done, the public or private organization should engage with you to explain what information you are seeking.You are not required to give a reason for requesting the information. The agency should not inquire as to why you want the information or how you intend to utilize it. You own the public information. You may submit a request for information to the public or private organization that you believe has the information you want. It is up to that agency or entity to transfer the request if they do not have the required information and to notify you of where they have moved your request. Requesting information should be as simple as possible, with no paperwork or formalities required. If you need assistance, the agency's information officer is available to help. As mentioned in the preceding section on automatic publishing, certain information may already be accessible without the need to submit a request.Will I be charged for the information?The FOI Law mandates that applications for information and searches be free of charge. The required papers are also available for free viewing. If you want a copy of the document, however, they may charge you for the actual cost of reproducing the requested material, such as photocopying, transcribing, scanning, or other kinds of reproduction. If you believe you were overcharged for the reproduction of the requested material, or if the agency attempted to charge you for anything else, you may seek an internal review of the decision. During an internal review, a senior official or review body will examine the fees imposed to see if they are legal. If you are still dissatisfied, you have the option of filing a complaint with the information commissioner. It costs nothing to inquire for information. Only the actual expenses of recreating the documents you request may be charged to you.After filing a request, what should I expect to happen next?Once you have submitted a request for information, the agency must begin processing it. Each agency may establish its own internal processing rules, but in general, the process starts with the agency noting the date your request was received, confirming receipt of your request, evaluating the request, and deciding if the information you want is kept inside the agency.In most cases, upon receiving a request for information, the information officer or other designated public servant should:Provide you with written confirmation that your request for information has been received and tell you the maximum number of days it should take to respond to your request.Check to see whether it has the information you're looking for, and if not, send your request to the appropriate organization.Give you one of the following responses: inspection or copy of the requested information written rejection of request notification of request transfer.When will I receive a response?Within thirty (30) calendar days, the agency must respond to all requests for information by post, e-mail, or hand delivery. If the agency can demonstrate good cause, it may extend the deadline for replying once. The one-time extension is for a maximum of thirty (30) days. The agency must accept your request and respond within 30 days, or document. According to the legislation, if the agency does not have the information you requested, it may transmit your request to the appropriate public agency or private business once within fifteen (15) days. If the agency to whom your request was moved does not have the information you need, your request may be transferred one more time, but it must be transmitted within ten (10) working days (approximately two weeks) after receipt. The agency moving the request must notify you where the request has been moved each time it is transferred, up to a maximum of two (2) times.Can my request be lawfully denied?Yes. According to the FOI law's ""exemption clause,"" a request for information may be rejected ONLY if the material sought comes under one of the exclusions listed in the FOI legislation and the damage of revealing the requested information outweighs the public's interest in viewing the document. Except in the case of transfers, all rejections must be in writing, provide a rationale for the refusal, and be sent to you within thirty (30) calendar days of the day the request was submitted.What are the exemptions included in the FOI Act?According to the Liberian Freedom of Information Act, a document, information, or record is excluded from public access ONLY if its publication will cause damage or significant harm to:National security, defense, or international relationsCriminal InvestigationTrade SecretsPrivileged communicationsWhen it would be an unreasonable revelation of personal information, a document is excluded from the general right of access to information. Your request will be rejected only if the material comes under an exemption and the damage of disclosure outweighs the public interest. In most cases, personal information is excluded from dissemination. To meet the public interest test, the agency must demonstrate the following: the requested information falls under one or more of the exemptions listed in the FOI Act; disclosure of the information will or is likely to cause injury or substantial harm to the interests protected by the exemptions; and the harm to be caused is greater than the benefit to be gained if the information is provided.What if I am not satisfied with the agency response or the agency does not respond?If you are still dissatisfied, you have the right to file an appeal with the Independent Information Commissioner. The information commissioner is obliged to examine your appeal request and make a final judgement. It is essential to remember that you do not need an attorney or a lawyer to request an internal review or to file an appeal with the Independent Information Commissioner. Throughout the appeals process, the agency must demonstrate that its judgement is lawful under FOI legislation. If your request is rejected due to an exemption, the agency must demonstrate that disclosing the material you sought will cause significant damage to the public that outweighs the benefit.What if I am still not satisfied?If you are still not satisfied with the Information Commissioner's judgement, you have the right to seek judicial review before the Civil Law Court in Montserrado County and the Circuit Court in the county where the public agency or private business is situated.Note: The researcher produced this media literacy article per the 2021 Kwame Karikari Fact-checking Fellowship in partnership with the Center for Media Studies and Peacebuilding to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",10/08/2021,https://dubawa.org/liberias-freedom-of-information-law-explained/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dear All,Please let' be very careful.. There is a new HIGH TECH FRAUD in town called the SIM SWAP FRAUD, and hundreds of persons are already VICTIMS.”How does it work? 1. A new fraud called SIM SWAP has started. Your phone network will momentarily go blind / zero (No Signal / Zero Bars) and after a while a call will come through. 2. The Person on the other end of the call will tell you that he is calling from (your cell phone company) depending on your network and that there is a problem in your mobile network. 3. He will instruct you to please press 1 on your phone to get the network back. - Please at this stage don' to Press anything, just cut or END the call. If you press 1, the network will appear suddenly and almost immediately go blind again (Zero Bars) and by that action, your phone is #HACKED. Within a second, they will empty your bank account, and you won't receive any alert.The alert warns further, What you will experience. It will appear as though your line is without Network; meanwhile your SIM has been SWAPPED.

I repeat don't forget to share this post. Many people's Account has been emptied! #UBAcares.VerificationIn our effort to verify the authenticity of the claim, we contacted Emmanuel K. Barnes, the Branch Manager of UBA Liberia for Redlight Branch, to verify the source of the claim but Barnes denied that the message originated from the Bank.“We are not the ones sending such messages, whatever message we have for our customers, we would send through phone number directly or post it on our face book page which is called UBA Liberia,” he said.He added that the system at the UBA is well built which makes it highly improbable for hackers to access and penetrate.Also, the head of Digital Marketing at UBA Liberia, Momolu Momo, said the bank has already received numerous calls from customers on the fraud alert but had informed them that the alert did not come from the Bank.“Some of our customers called to find out why some of them did not receive the message on their phones but instead seeing it on social media platforms, but we told them it was not from us,” he said.Our reporter also spoke with the communications manager at Orange Liberia Betty Flahn, one of Liberia’s leading GSM companies who said that it is impossible to swap a person's sim with just a phone call.A Liberian IT expert Lauren E.

DUBAWA’s fact-checking training holds in Liberia,Silas Jonathan,"Twenty-two Liberian journalists drawn from the country’s print, broadcast and online press will begin a four-day training in fact-checking training at the Murex Plaza and Suites in Monrovia Wednesday 28 July where Deputy Minister for Information, Mr. Boakai Fofana, will open the event with an address on “Stemming the Spread of Misinformation in Liberia to Advance Good Governance and Democracy.”The training is organized by the West African fact-checking initiative, DUBAWA, a project of the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ).“We are honoured and privileged to be in Liberia to support our peers in executing this training on the global information crisis of misinformation and disinformation, and the challenges they pose to democracy, electoral integrity, public health and sound public policy in the country,” said Oluwatosin Alagbe, the Programme Director of PTCIJ in a statement Tuesday from Monrovia.Ms. Alagbe said the training will be conducted in collaboration with The Stage Media, an indigenous Liberian fact-checking organisation, formed last year, and that the scope of the training will cover accountability journalism, theory and history of fact-checking, as well as the structure and ethics of the practice. Other skills trainees will acquire are: how to conduct a full-fledged fact-checking exercise; how to identify best sources for fact-checking; how to use multimedia verification tools for fact-checking and how to interpret data and understand numbers.“We expect trainees from the programme to also learn how to use data and geolocation tools as well as the Freedom of Information Law to reinforce their fact checking practice,” said Ms. Alagbe, adding that the leadership of the Liberian Press Union, the Female Journalist Association, the Centre for Media and Society, the Accountability Lab, civil society captains and a string of officials from the diplomatic community will grace the occasion.Liberia’s media has a strong tradition of promoting accountability since the 1826 founding of the Liberian Herald by Charles Force but fact-checking is recent with Stage media, and an erstwhile leader in rural journalism, Local Voices, which incorporated fact checking into its journalism earlier this year, helping to fight misinformation and promoting media literacy in the country.Experts and facilitators that will conduct the training are: Dapo Olorunyomi, the Executive Director, Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism; Malcolm Joseph, Executive Director, Center for Media Studies and Peacebuilding; Adedeji Adekunle, Director, DUBAWA and Caroline Anipah, Programmes Manager, DUBAWA Ghana.About DUBAWADUBAWA is a transnational verification and fact-checking platform, initiated by the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ) in 2018.

"Suggestions that AstraZeneca vaccine is causing COVID infections, FALSE!",Wremongar Joe,"Claim: Social media messages suggest the AstraZeneca vaccine can transmit COVID-19 and may be responsible for hike in COVID-19 Cases in LiberiaAlthough there has been a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in Liberia, there is no evidence that the administration of the AstraZeneca Vaccine is responsible for this. The suggestion that the vaccine can cause COVID-19 is FALSE.Full TextA new COVID-19 variant has emerged in Liberia as the country records a new peak in infections. While virus mutations are not unusual, those that are more infectious are worrisome, making people respond in different ways across various social media platforms. Speculations have emerged in street corners that the wave of increase in COVID-19 cases in Liberia can be attributed to the Astrazeneca vaccine being administered across the country.On Saturday June 19, 2021, a Facebook user shared a post questioning whether or not it was the vaccine causing an increase in infection.In the post which has since been deleted, the user asked his Facebook following: “have we noticed since the introduction of the vaccines, the cases have hiked?” Roll-out of the AstraZeneca VaccineThe World Health Organization (WHO) early this year listed AstraZeneca and Oxford University's COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, widening access to the relatively inexpensive shot in the developing world.AWHOstatement said it had approved thevaccineas produced by AstraZeneca-SKBio (Republic of Korea) and the Serum Institute of India.According to a study by the US Center for Disease Control, AstraZeneca committed to a partnership with Oxford University to ensure broad and equitable vaccine access globally during the pandemic.Liberia received 96,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, through the COVAX facility on April 1, 2021, joining many countries to officially launch the vaccination campaign against COVID-19.The Minister of Health, Dr. Wilhelmina Jallah, launched the vaccine at the Ministerial Complex in the presence of the UN Head of Agencies, the United Kingdom and European Union Ambassadors, representatives of other development partners, Cabinet Ministers, chairs of the health committees at the legislature, senior government officials and the media.The vaccines were later deployed to eight sites in Montserrado and Margibi counties including; the Number 14 Military hospital, JFK memorial hospital, Catholic hospital, Redemption and SOS Hospitals.VerificationCan AstraZeneca Vaccines transmit Covid-19?Dr Wilhemina Jallah, Liberia’s Minister of Health in a phone call with his reporter on Wednesday June 23, 2021 dismissed this claim. Dr Jallah said the Ministry of Health was in possession of “no reports or evidence” that suggest that the vaccine is capable of infecting people with COVID-19.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the AstraZeneca vaccines were tested in state-of-the-art laboratories, tried in thousands of renowned clinics and approved by WHO.The same vaccines are being administered all over the world, including countries in Africa, like Ghana, Sierra Leone, Mali and Morocco.Dubawa found no evidence that the AstraZeneca vaccine can get people infected with COVID-19 in any of these countries.According to a recent study by the UK based Public Health England, a single dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccine reduced household transmission by up to half. It finds no evidence that AstraZeneca vaccine, which is also administered in Liberia, can also cause COVID infection.The Australian Government’s Department of Health’s patient information fact-sheet on AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) also finds no evidence that the vaccine can infect people with COVID-19 once taken.Can one get COVID-19 even after receiving the AstraZeneca Vaccine?The US Center for Disease Control says after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, the vaccinated person cannot test positive for COVID-19 on a viral test - a test which is used to determine if an individual has a current infection. The CDC further states that none of the authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines cause a person to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if one has a current infection.? Neither can any of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in clinical trials in the United States.?Cases of fully vaccinated individuals contracting coronavirus are rare, but not impossible. The CDC says a small percentage of fully vaccinated individuals will still get the infection but may make sickness less severe in such people.ConclusionGiven the scientific evidence available, the suggestion that AstraZeneca could be responsible for hundreds of new COVID-19 cases in Liberia is FALSE and Misleading.Note: The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa’s 2021 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership withThe Center for Media Studies and Peacebuilding to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",28/06/2021,https://dubawa.org/suggestions-that-astrazeneca-vaccine-is-causing-covid-infections-false/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Debunked: Viral False Claims Following the Demise of TB Joshua,Bettie Kemah Johnson-Mbayo,"Following the announcement of the death of the televangelist and founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), Prophet Temitope Joshua (popularly known as T.B Joshua) June 5, Saturday, several false claims about him have surfaced.TB Joshua, considered one of Africa’s most influential and controversial preachers, is reported to have passed away on the way to hospital after a church service.In this fact-check report, we tackle three of the viral claims we have seen.Claim 1: TB Joshua Coffin unveiledFull TextVideos circulating on Facebook and YouTube are said to be portraying the coffin of T.B Joshua.The YouTube account Press Play, AS Media and a Facebook account John Diki Helen are among those who published videos with the title TB Joshua coffin.The videos have attracted several reactions from social media users.VerificationThough SCOAN has announced that the funeral will begin on July 5, it is safe to say that the church has not unveiled the coffin of TB Joshua and the videos are Fake.The family quoted by the BBC and the Herald said the televangelist will be buried in Lagos.Claim 2: Angel appeared at TB Joshua’s funeralFull TextA story published by the Global News Nigeria titled ‘Mysterious Angel appears at TB Joshua Burial (Video)’ reports that an angel appeared at TB Joshua’s burial. The story was also published by Riddims GhanaAnother photo and video shared hundreds of times on Facebook and YouTube claim to show the American cable news channel CNN broadcasting 'the mysterious angel appearance' at the supposed funeral of T. B. Joshua. It said Joshua had been secretly buried, and the angel sighted was ""dangling from the roof"".VerificationA Fact Check by All News Nigeria debunked the publication.Dubawa used Reverse image- Yandex and traced the image to the funeral service of Pastor Dare Adeboye, the son of Pastor Enoch Adeboye of Redeemed Christian Church of God [RCCG], who died on 4 May.Though the video carried a CNN logo with a headline, the image is doctored.The American News outlet CNN did not publish such a story. Also, TB Joshua has not yet been buried contrary to the claim that he was buried in Arigidi, Akoko Ekare.A story published by the BBC states that he will be buried inside SCOAN church headquarters, Lagos.Claim 3: TB Joshua Coffin healed woman of CancerFull TextA YouTube video claims TB Joshua’s coffin has healed a woman of cancer.“Hello friend and welcome to another interesting video in our channel. TB Joshua Coffin heals Woman sick of Cancer for 6years. Family in tears ???? Thanks so much for stopping by and watching the video till the end. Please you can as well hit the like button immediately after watching the video , followed by hitting the subscribe button and the bell icon so that you don't miss out in our next video.

It is therefore impossible for the supposed healing to have happened.The televangelist’s coffin has not cured a woman of cancer.",22/06/2021,https://dubawa.org/debunked-viral-false-claims-following-the-demise-of-tb-joshua/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No! Gun Woman standing by Charles Taylor’s ex-wife not Senator Kanger Lawrence,Wremongar Joe,"Claim: Viral image of a gun woman is being paraded on Facebook with captions suggesting her to be Senator Nyonblee Kangar-LawrenceThe viral image of an armed woman standing by Charles Taylor’s former wife, Agnes Taylor, is not senator Nyonblee Kangar Lawrence as suggested in several Facebook posts.Full TextSenator Nyonblee Kangar Lawrence (LP, Grand Bassa County), the Political leader of the Liberty Party, has for weeks come under intense scrutiny over a viral image circulated on Facebook by several users.The image shows Mrs. Agnes Taylor, Charles Taylor's ex-wife, flanked by a woman attired in a military outfit with a long gun on her right shoulder.Facebook posters have suggested that the woman carrying a gun in the photograph is Senator Kangar-Lawrence, who chairs the Liberian Senate's Committee on Rules Order and Administration.The picture went viral at a time when advocacy for accountability for widespread and systematic violations of international human rights and humanitarian law that characterized two brutal armed conflicts between 1989 and 2003 have heightened in weeks.Earlier, Nimba County Senator, Prince Johnson, who according to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s (TRC) report bears some of the greatest responsibilities of the wars accused Senator Kanger-Lawrence in the plenary of the Liberian Senate of being a rebel fighter.A Facebook user by name Adama Senatorbiney Cousin Fofana posted on the image with the caption: “Nyonblee Kangar Lawrence in a situation she can’t handle”.His post was followed by two others, one from a popular block named- Pepper Bird and another account named RDTV.What was surprising to many was a post with the same image from Ms. Wade Williams, a former desk editor of FrontPageAfricaNewspaper who now resides in the United States. Wade posted to Facebook a cropped version of the viral image tagging Senator Lawrence as “bodyguard” during the wars.VerificationAccording to Mrs. Agnes Reeves Taylor, the former wife of Charles Taylor (the woman standing on the right in the photo), the picture was taken at Du-side Hospital, which is located on the Firestone Rubber Plantation in Margibi County on August 17, 1990, by a French photographer named Patrick Robey.In an interview with this reporter on Friday, June 11, 2021, she confirmed that Robey took the picture outside of Du-side Hospital compound just before she could embark her vehicle upon her return from the hospital, to identify wounded soldiers who were moved to the hospital for advance treatment.She said she could recollect the event and date of the picture because the French photographer who took the picture issued a statement to explain events surrounding the controversial image in her trial in the UK on accusation of torture.Asked if the woman standing on her left was Senator Nyonblee Kanagar Lawrence, as stated by Facebook users, she replied “no”.“That lady in the photo making rounds on social media is Cecelia Lewis, who later became Chief of Taskforce of the Liberia National Police in the administration of Charles Taylor and not the Grand Bassa County Senator,” Taylor said.Ms. Lewis later died in a plane crash along with police Director Joe Tate and several others on Wednesday, August 11, 1999.The former wife of Charles Taylor, however, indicated that it was a security strategy to have Lewis dressed in a military outfit like her so that soldiers could be wondering who Agnes Taylor really was.Madam Lewis is survived by her son Enreki Johnson. Due to the intense discussion of her late mother’s picture, he took to Facebook on May 17, 2020 asking that her late mother be left alone to “rest in her grave.”ConclusionBased on the evidence available, the woman carrying a gun in the viral image posted on Facebook by many users is not Senator Nyonblee Kangar Lawrence of Grand Bassa but Madam Cecelia Lewis Johnson who later died in a plane crash in 1999.The researcher produced this fact-check per the 2021 Kwame Karikari Fact-checking Fellowship partnership with the Center for Media Studies and Peacebuilding to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",22/06/2021,https://dubawa.org/no-gun-woman-standing-by-charles-taylors-ex-wife-not-senator-kanger-lawrence/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fact-checking Senator Brown’s claim that no President has moved into Liberia’s Executive Mansion since the killing of President William R. Tolbert,Wremongar Joe,"Claim: Senator J. Gblehbo Brown says no President has moved into Liberia’s executive mansion since the killing of President William R. TolbertSamuel K Doe lived and worked from the mansion until he was killed while Ellen Johnson Sirleaf worked from the executive mansion until it was gutted by fire on July 26, 2006. Charles Taylor also spent some time in the mansion.Full TextJ. Gblehbo Brown who represents Maryland County in the Liberian Senate on Thursday, June 10, 2021, said at a peacebuilding and reconciliation event that since President William R Tolbert was murdered in the executive mansion, no other president has been able to move into the mansion.Senator Brown chairs the Liberian Senate’s Committee on Internal Affairs, Reconciliation, and Governance.He was invited to speak on behalf of the senate at the launch of a report which borders on national reconciliation, peacebuilding, and social cohesion, an effort led by the Civil Society National Reconciliation Working Group.The report, launched under the theme “Rethinking Reconciliation and Social Cohesion in Liberia”, is seeking efforts that can lead to an overall process of post-conflict reconstruction and development (PCRD).""It appears that Liberians do not know what to do with this TRC (Truth and Reconciliation Report) report,"" he said. “To have genuine conciliation and sustained peace, we must establish the root cause of the wars.”“Liberians have been divided from the foundation of the nation...Tolbert was killed in his bed in that executive mansion and since then, no other president has been able to move into that mansion,” Senator Brown said.VerificationThe executive mansion of Liberia is the official residence and workplace of Liberia’s Presidents. Dedicated on January 3, 1964, during the presidency of William VS Tubman, it is situated across the street from the Capitol Building in central Monrovia.On April 12, 1980, a non-commissioned officer of the Armed Forces of Liberia and members of his Krahn ethnic group, attacked the executive mansion in a bloody coup d'é tat and murdered President Tolbert in his bedroom which was located on the eighth floor of the mansion’s residential complex. Thirteen of Tolbert’s cabinet ministers were also killed in the aftermath of the coup.Presidents Who Have Lived in The MansionFrom April 12, 1980, the day Master Sergeant Samuel K Doe launched his coup d'etat, he occupied the executive mansion until he was murdered by Prince Johnson’s rebel forces at the Freeport of Monrovia on September 9, 1990, Monrovia.In this Facebook live interview with journalist Clarence Jackson of Okay FM Liberia, Mrs. Nancy Doe, the wife of Samuel K Doe indicated the family had lived in the mansion.“All our time in the executive mansion, we never anticipated that this would happen,” she said.In this documentary by the BBC Sound, titled the “Death of Samuel Doe”, former BBC correspondent Elizabeth Blunt narrated how Doe had left the executive mansion for the Freeport of Monrovia for a meeting with an ECOMOG commander when Prince Johnson’s forces arrived.From April 12, 1980 when Doe overthrew Tolbert and was elected president in October 1985, he resided in the executive mansion. This can further be confirmed by a New York Times July 7, 1990 publication where the US-based newspaper reported that he had told American diplomats that he would resign, but so far he had shown no sign of leaving.After the Samuel K Doe regime ended in 1990, Charles Taylor became the second elected President of Liberia after Toblert and he was inaugurated in office on August 2, 1997. Taylor worked from the executive mansion even though he was not resident there.Charles Taylor held official duties in the executive mansion ranging from hosting foreign guests and other state functions, even though he was resident at two houses in Congo Town.BBC journalist Robin White meets Charles Taylor at the Executive MansionBBC reporter Bobin White is quoted in this article as saying:“I first met Taylor face-to-face in the Executive Mansion in Monrovia in 2000.”The paper is quoted as saying “throughout the day, the 40-year-old President remained barricaded inside the executive mansion. Armored vehicles and soldiers were stationed on the palace lawn.""President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was elected President of Liberia in October 2005, the third democratically elected president after Tolbert who also moved into the executive mansionFrom January 2006 to July 26, 2006, former President Sirleaf did all official business in the executive mansion until a portion of the mansion on the fourth floor was destroyed by fire during the 159th-anniversary celebration of the adoption of the Liberian Declaration of Independence. President Sirleaf was at the time feting foreign guests and dignitaries in the gardens of the Executive Mansion.The renovation process is still ongoing.It is fair to state that President Goerge Weah is the only elected president who has not been able to work from the executive mansion.ConclusionFrom the analysis and investigations relating to the claim made by Maryland J. Gblehbo Brown, it is clear that the claim is false. Even though Presidents Charles Taylor and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf did not reside in the executive mansion, the conclusion that no President has moved into the mansion since the murder of President William R. Tolbert is false.The researcher produced this fact-check per Dubawa's 2021 Kwame Karikari Fact-checking Fellowship in partnership with the Center for Media Studies and Peacebuilding to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",15/06/2021,https://dubawa.org/fact-checking-senator-browns-claim-that-no-president-has-moved-into-liberias-executive-mansion-since-the-killing-of-president-william-r-tolbert/,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
